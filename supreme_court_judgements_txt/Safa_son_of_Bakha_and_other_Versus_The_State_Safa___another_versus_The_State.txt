The above conviction and sentences awar ded by the learned Trial Court was upheld in appeal/revision by learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court except the amount of compensation which was enhanced from Rs. 200,000/ - to Rs. 300,000/ - by accepting the Criminal Revision No. 13/2011 to this extent, which is to be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased. 6. 

Mr. 

Jahanzaib Khan Advocate appearing on behalf of the complainant submits that it was a day light occurrence and the FIR of the instant case has also been registered promptly. 

The convicts have been attributed specific and direct role in commission of the said brutal murder and injuring the lady. 

He also submits that the names of the eye witnesses are also mentioned in the FIR who during recording their examination -in- chief as well as durin g cross examination directly charged the accused attributing them the specific role s. 

He further submits that the prosecution has proved its case beyond any reasonable doubt s by producing Eye witnesses, recovery of blood stained earth from the scene of occ urrence, the Inquest Report, Chemical Examiner Report, Fire Arm Expert Report, report of Radiologist and the recovery of weapon of crime recovered by the police on the pointation of the convicts Safa & Gul Muhammad etc. 

He also submits that the convicts could not produce any defence in support of their version. 

He reiterates that all the eye witnesses are independent and inspiring confidence who corroborated each other. 

He prayed that the Criminal Appeal No. 21/2015 be

6 dismissed whereas the Criminal Appe al No. 20/2015 be allowed and sentences awarded to the respondent No. 01 Safa & respondent No. 02 Gul Muhammad may kindly be converted form life imprisonment into death sentence and the conviction /sentences i.e. seven (07) years imprisonment awarded to th e respondent No. 03 Mir Wali & respondent No. 04 namely Riaz may also be enhanced from seven (07) years to life imprisonment to meet the ends of justice. 

The learned Advocate General supports the arguments of the learned counsel for the complainant. 7. 

On the other hand, Mr. 

Munir Ahmed Advocate alongwith Mr. 

Johar Ali Khan learned counsel for the respondents in Criminal Appeal No. 20/2015 support the impugned judgment dated 26.03.2014 in Criminal Revision N0. 13/2011 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court whereas the impugned judgment passed in Criminal Appeal No. 15/2011 is not tenable and liable to set aside as the prosecutio n has miserably failed to prove its case beyond the reasonable doubts. 

They contend that the FIR is doubtful as contrary to the facts of case. 

The Post Mortem of the dead body of the deceased has not been conducted which creates serious doubt in of prosecution case. 

The cause of the death is not known as to whether deceased Jamsheed e xpired due to bullet injuries or otherwise. 

Likewise the injury caused to Mst. 

Zulaikha has not been supported by the corroborative evidence and the same has also not been confirmed by the statement of any eye

============================================================

7 witness. 

They contend that the crime weapon s recovered from the accused on his pointation has not been proved. 

The crime weapon was sent to Lahore for expert opinion whereas the ballistic report was issued from Peshawar. 

They reiterate that the weapon of offence was sent for expert opinion after cons iderable unexplained delay which also creates doubt in the story of the prosecution. 

They submit that there are glaring contradictories in the statements of the PWs and medical evidences regarding the number of bullets received by the deceased and the inju red lady who were allegedly fired/hit by the convict respondent s. 

They further contend that the respondent No. 03 & 04 namely Mir Wali and Riaz have been released after serving their conviction/sentences. 

They finally argue that the case of the prosecution is full of doubts and the benefit of doubts has not been extended to the accused/respondents as per parameter s laid down by the superior courts in administering criminal justice system. 

They pray that Criminal Appeal No. 21/2015 be allowed, conviction and s entence s awarded to the respondent No. 01 & 02 may graciously be set aside or alternatively. 

Keeping in view the age factor of the convict the same may graciously be reduced into already undergone and the Criminal Appeal No. 20/2015 filed against Safa, Gul Muhammad, Mir Wali and Riaz be dismissed. 8. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned judgment dated 26.03.2014 in Criminal

============================================================

8 Appeal No. 15 /2011 & Criminal Revision No. 13/2011 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court as well as the judgment dated 24.09.2011 in Session Case No. 61/2011 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge Chilas District Diamer. 

No illegality, infirmity or misappreciation of evidence was pointed in the concurrent findings of both the courts below by the learned counsels appearing for the convicts/appellants/respondents in both the appeals. 

Consequently, no interference is warranted. 9. 

In view of the above discussions, we dismiss both the Criminal Appeal Nos. 21/2015 and 20/2015 filed by both the complainant and the convicted ac cused respectively. 

Consequent thereto, the impugned judgment s dated 26.03.2014 passed in Criminal Appea l No. 15/2011 & Criminal Revision No. 13/2011 by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court as well as the judgment dated 24.09.2011 in Session Case No. 61/2011 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge Chilas District Diamer are maintained. 10.
