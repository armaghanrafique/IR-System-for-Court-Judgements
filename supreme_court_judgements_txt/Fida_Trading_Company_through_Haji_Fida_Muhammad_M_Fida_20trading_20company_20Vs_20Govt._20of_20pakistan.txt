Briefly the facts of the case are that the petitioner filed a Civil Suit No. 118/1991 in the cour t of the learned Civil Judge Skardu for rendition of Accounts against the respondents in respect of the completion of 19.4 kilometer road from Kundus Mouth to Siachin Sector on the basis of labour supply agreement vide Agreement dated 14.09.1988 and 23.09. 1988 between the respective parties. 

Later on terms and conditions altered and it was agreed that the payment shall be made on the basis of work done. 

The work on the site completed in the year 1990 under the said terms / conditions resultantly a some of R s. 26,00,000 (Rs. 2.6 million) has been paid to the petitioner by the respondents. 

The remaining amount as claimed by the petitioner has not been paid by the respondent No. 02 to 07 in violation of the agreed terms and conditions. 

Consequently, the petitio ner constrained to file the Civil Suit in the court of learned Civil Judge Skardu -II. 

As per averments of the petitioners issues were framed by the learned trial Court and the main issues have also been proved in favour of the petitioner, however, the sai d suit upon hearing was dismissed vide judgment dated 20.10.201, on the sole ground of cause of action. 

The petitioner feeling aggrieved filed CFA No. 02/2012 which upon hearing was also dismissed vide impugned judgment dated 29.08.2016 on the basis of l ack of evidence by declaring the judgment of the learned trial Court in accordance with law.

3 the plaintiff /petitioner to amend the said Suit into recovery suit which was acted u pon by the petitioner accordingly. 3. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner fully proved his case by producing and adducing oral as well as documentary evidence in support of its claim. 

The learned trial court failed to appreciate the same and fell in error in dismissing the suit by holding that the petitioner /plaintiff has no cause of action to file the suit against the respondents/defendants. 

Per learned counsel the Chief Court instead of disposing off the first appeal in accordance with the provisions of Order 41 Rule 31 CPC, arbitrarily and summarily dismissed it beyond the pleadings and record of the case. 

He further submits that in case the issue No. 4 i.e. with regard to the existence of cause of action is proved in favour of the petitioner, the nature an d status of the suit would have been changed altogether but the learned trial court failed to resolve the same. 

The learned Appellate Court has also failed to resolve the issue No.04 as well. 

Per learned counsel for the petitioner both the courts below fel l in error while deciding the disputed questions of fact. 

Consequently, the impugned order dated 29.08.2016 passed by the learned Chief Court as well as the judgment dated 20.10.2011in Civil Suit No. 51/2010 (Old No. 58/2003) passed by learned trial court are not sustainable as a result of misreading and non -appreciation of evidence and material on record. 

He prays that the impugned order/judgment passed by the Courts below be set aside by remanding back the

4 case to the learned first appellate court fo r disposal of appeal on merit to secure the ends of justice. 4. 

On the other hand, the learned Deputy Attorney General for Pakistan at Gilgit -Baltistan supports the concurrent findings of the two courts below. 

He contends that the respondents have alrea dy made payment to the petitioner as per agreement for the construction of the said road and there is nothing payable to the petitioner by the respondents. 

The agreement and the payment on the basis of work done is past and closed transaction which can not be re -opened. 

He also contends that the respondents not only made all payments as per agreement but also provided explosives, detonators and cement etc to the petitioner for completion of the road project. 

He further contends that the claim for remaining amount by the petitioner is baseless and uncalled for. 

Admittedly the petitioner had failed to produce any evidence to support his claim except two witnesses i.e. one was his driver and the other was his mason who may be termed as interested witnesses. 

Pe r learned Deputy Attorney General the petitioner produced certain fake and fabricated documents in support of his claim which were not considered by the Courts below. 

He also contends that no corroborative evidence was produced by the petitioner in suppor t of his claim. 

Per learned Deputy Attorney General the learned counsel for the petitioner, otherwise, could not point out any illegality, irregularity and infirmity in the concurrent findings of the Courts below as such interference into it is not warrant ed.
