4 but the same have not been appreciated and considered by the learned Trial Court as well as by the learned Chief Court, hence, the impugned judgment and the judgment of the learned Trial Court are not tenable in law. 

He prays that the impugned judgment may graciously be set aside being passed contrary to the facts of the case and law. 5. 

We have heard the learned Advocate General at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned judgment as well as the judgme nt passed by the learned Trial Court. 

The learned Advocate General also could not point out any infirmity or illegality in the said impugned judgment. 

In our considered view, the impugned judgment and the judgment of the learned Trial Court are well reason ed and well founded, hence, no indulgence is warranted into it. 6. 

In view of the above discussions, we convert this Cr. 

Petition into an appeal and the same is dismissed. 

Consequently, the impugned judgment dated 17. 05.2017 in Cr.
