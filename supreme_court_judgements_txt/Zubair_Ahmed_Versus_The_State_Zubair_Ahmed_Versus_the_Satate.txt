5 the learned Chief Court in Criminal Appeal No. 08/2014 as well as the judgment dated 30.04.2014 in Session Case No. 12/2013 passed by the lea rned Trial Court Gilgit. 

Notice to the special Prosecutor ANF was issued on 04.05.2015 and consequently the case was heard today. 

After hearing the learned counsels for t he respective parties at length, Mr. 

Amjad Hussain learned counsel for the petitioner very humbly submits that he on instructions from his client will not press the petition and prays for reduction in sentences. 

He further submits that the petitioner committed the offence in a mitigating circumstances. 

He is a young man having large family responsibilities. 

Due to his detention in jail, he and his family have morally and mentally suffered a lot and financially crippled. 

He has learnt a lesson and has shown remorse and penitence and wants to unburden his conscious. 

During serving his sentence in jail he has improved himself a lot and realized his mistakes by committing such shameful offence which has given bad name to his whole religious family. 

The learned advocate for the petitioner further contends that the petitioner undertook not to repeat such an offence in future. 

He wants to reform and rehabilitate himself as a responsible citi zen. 

He finally submits that the e nds of justice have already been served. 

While submitting so he support s his contention s by relying upon case laws reported as Jameel Khan & others versus The State, (PLD 2008, Karachi, 376), Waris Khan versus The State, (PLD 2006 Karachi, 648 ),

6 Muhammad Hashim versus The State, (PLD 2004 SC 856), Unchenna Ibeneme versus The State, (1992 MLD 1823 ), Rodriguez Narciso versus The State (2000 MLD 218), John Chibuzo versus The State (2000 MLD 235), Jaffar versus The State, (2008 PCr.LJ 1540), Ru bina versus The State & others, (2009 PCr.LJ ), Ikhtiar versus The State, (2009 PCr.LJ 355) and Muhammad Ayub versus The State, (2009 PCr.LJ 403). 

He contends that in all the aforementioned cases the Hon’ble High Courts and the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan have leniently considered the offences committed in mitigating circumstances and the appellants /petitioners have shown remorse and penitence by giving undertakings to reform and rehabilitate as responsible citizen in the society and their substantive sentences and fines were reduced. 

On the other hand, the learned Special Prosecut or appearing on behalf o f the State submits that since the petitioner has not challenged the convictions/sentences awarded to him by both the courts below, therefore, the appeal of the petitioner may be dismissed and conviction be maintained. 

He opposed to the reduction in sentence s as the learned Trial Court has awarded lesser punishment. 

The learned counsel also submits that under Section 9 (C ) as the quantity of recovered charas was twenty five (25) kgs and under Section 9 (C ) First Proviso of CNS Act 1997 the minimum sentence provided was life imprisonment. 

This Court inquired from the learned Prosecutor for ANF as to why the State

============================================================

7 has not filed Criminal Revision for enhancement of sentence, on which the learned Prosecutor ANF could not offer any expla nation. 

We have heard both the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned judgments passed by the two courts below as well as the case laws referred by Mr. 

Amjad Hussain, the learned counsel for the petitioner which supports his contentions. 

Further the perusal of the record shows that the petitioner/accused is in custody since 30.01.2013. 

He is the first offender who has shown his remorse and penitence during serving the sentence in jail. 

He has already served upon more than three (03) years in jail and as per record his conduct found satisfactory. 

He also wants to reform and rehabilitate himself as a responsible citizen in the society in future. 

In our considered view the p etitioner deserves for leniency as prayed for. 

In view of the above facts, circumstances and in persuance of case laws cited by Mr. 

Amjad Hussain the lea rned counsel for the petitioner, we convert this petition into an appeal and the same is dismissed as not pressed. 

The conviction is maintained, however, the substantive sentence is reduced from eight (08) years R.I to five (05) years R.I and the fine of Rs. 100,000/ - (rupees one lac only) is also reduced to Rs. 50,000/ - (rupees fifty thousand only). 

In default in payment of fine he has to further undergo for six (06) months R.I instead of S.I. 

The benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC has already been extended to the petitioner
