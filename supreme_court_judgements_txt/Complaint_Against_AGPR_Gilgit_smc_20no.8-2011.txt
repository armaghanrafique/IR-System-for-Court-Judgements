The matter came up before the court on 24/06/2011. 

The Court observed that the Accountant General Gilgit­ Baltistan despite notices remained absent on the date of hearing i.e. 24/06/2011 and two other officers of AGPR, Raja Janghi Buhadur, Accounts Officer and Mr.

It was observed further that the Accountant General Gilgit­Baltistan was directed to explain his position as to why he had not appeared and as to whether his conduct is an interference and interruption in the affairs of the Court. 

In this view of the matter the conduct of AGPR Gilgit squarely falls within the ambit of Article 75 of Gilgit­ Baltistan (Empowerment and Self­ Governance) Order, 2009. 3. 

On 04/07/2011’’Abdul Hameed Pasha” Accontant General Gilgit­ Baltistan in pursuance of the order of this Court appeared in Chamber and placed on record his reply to show cause notice dated o2­07­2011 ( Annex “A’) wherein he has very categorically stated that being a senior officer, he cannot think of defying the court orders. 4.On 08­08­2011, another incident had taken place and this court had also taken the notice to the effect that the staff of AGPR called a strike on 24th July, 2011 while raising derogatory slogans and staged an agitation at the main gate of the Court. 

In addition thereto a report was lodged by another official of AGPR consequent whereupon a case was registered under Section 500/501 PPC against Liaqat Alam and his brother with the police Station Gilgit City who had filed the complaint against Accounts Officer before this court. 

Moreover, Mr.

unconditional apology nor has submitted satisfactory reply to show cause notice. 

He was directed to submit a proper reply in this regard whereas 04 other officials of AGPR namely, Mr.

The Court vide order dated 08/08/2011 directed the AGPR to hold an inquiry into the conduct of officers and on the completion of inquiry the responsibility of the employees be also fixed who had committed act of raising slogans derogatory to the honour and respect of the Court. 

He, in pursuance thereof, had appointed Mr. 

Muhammad Raza, Accounts Officer as inquiry Officer. 

Since, it was a very serious matter pertaining to the institution of judiciary, they cannot be allowed to disgrace and lower the dignity, honour and authority of the Court and it was considered appropriate to inquire into the matter by an independent inquiry committee to be constituted by Chief Secretary Gilgit­ Baltistan. 

The Inquiry Committee was constituted accordingly and required to conclude the proceedings within a period of one month and on the completion of the inquiry the report would be submitted to the Registrar of this Court.
