4 No. 56/2013, passed by the learned Additional District Judge Hunza/Nagar are well r easoned and well founded and the same are require d to be maintained. 

He further submits that the judgment dated 31.05.2013, passed by the learned Civil Judge 1st class Nagar in Civil Suit No.10/2009 has rightly been reversed by the both the learned Court s below being against the facts and law. 

We have heard both the learned counsel for the respective parties at length, perused the record of case file and gone through the impugned judgments of all the three Courts below. 

In our considered view, the impu gned judgment da ted, 17.03.2014, passed by the learned Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan as well as the judgment dated 19.09.2013, passed by the learned Additional District Judge Hunza/Nagar are well reasoned and well founded as no infirmity and illegality was pointed out by the learned counsel for the Petitioners, the same are therefore, maintained and hold that the learned First Appellate Court rightly reversed the judgment in Civil Suit No. 10/2009, dated 31.05.2013, passed by the learned Civil Judge Nagar. 

We accordingly converted the petition into an appeal and dismissed by short order dated 21.09.2015 and these were the reasons for it dismissal. 

The appeal is dismissed.
