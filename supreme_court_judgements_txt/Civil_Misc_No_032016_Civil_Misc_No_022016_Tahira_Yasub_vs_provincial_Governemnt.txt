SI NO. 29 Deputation Not a Method Appointment. 

Reference Establishment Division O.M. 

No. 1/28/75 -D.II/R - 3/R.I, dated 18.2.1987 (SI No. 27), wherein the normal period of the deputation for all categories of Government Servants had been fixed as three years, extendable by another two years with the prior approval of the competent authority. 

Under the said instruction Secretaries of the Ministries/Divisions concerned were a uthorized to grant extension in deputation period beyond the initial period of three years in respect of Government Servants holding posts BPS -17 to BPS -19. 

It has been observed, however, that there is growing tendency to resolve to postings through dep utationist despite the fact that deputation is not a normal prescribed method of appoint as under the Civil Servants (appointment, Promotion and Transfer) Rule 1973, three methods of appointments are required to

============================================================
PAGE 9
============================================================

9 be made either by promotion or by initial appointment or by transfer. 

The Method of appointment to post is also described in the Recruitment Rules. 

Filling up the posts through deputation, if not provided so in the recruitment Rules, leads to following adverse implications: - (i). in case of prom otion posts, the promotions of departmental personnel are delayed/stopped. (ii). 

In case the post is required to be filled through initial appointment, quota of a particular province is affected. 

In order to bring the deputation policy in conformity wit h the present policy of postings and transfers circulated vide Establishment Division‟s O.M. 

No. 10/10/94 -R-2, dated 22.03.1994, (SI No. 3) and also to discourage the increasing tendency of posting through deputation, it has been decided that, in future, t he deputation period will be limited to three years only. 

A maximum two years extension in the deputation period will be considered only in exceptional cases, in the public interest, and with the prior approval of the Establishment Division in all cases Government Servants in BPS - 17 and above. 

The extension cases shall be forwarded to the Establishment Division atleast six months before the expiry of the three -year deputation period and with proper justification for the proposal. 

However, no deputation pro posals will be entertained which will adversely affect the method of appointment to the post as laid d own in the recruitment rules. 

Accordingly all such proposals must invariably be accompanied by a formal assurance signed by atleast the joint Secretary (A dmin) to that affect. 

Ministries/Divisions are requested to also bring these instructions to the notice of their Attached Department, Subordinate Offices, Corporations, Autonomous Bodies, etc, under their administrative control, for guidance/strict compli ance. 

It may pleased be noted that arrangements have been made in consultation with the Auditor General‟s Office whereby payment of emoluments etc, to those on deputation will be stopped forthwith, immediately following the completion of the three years de putation period, unless the Establishment Division‟s prior approval has been obtained and conveyed to the concerned Audit Circle. 

The existing instructions on this subject issued vide Establishment Division O.M. 

No. 1/28/75 -D.II/R -3/R.I, dated 18.2.1987 (S I No. 27), stand modified to the above extent.

The learned counsel for the petitioners also contends that the placement of the services of the respondent No. 07 at the disposal of FIA was also illegal and against the law and service Rules as he was on deputation at Gilgit -Baltistan Police on standard terms and conditions and before the expiry of the said period his services again placed at the disposal of another department was illegal and without lawful authority. 

A deputationist cannot be given another deputation before expiry of the first deputation period. 

The same illegality was also pointed out by the respondents NO. 01 to 06 and they consequently issued an order recalling his deputation. 

Consequently, he was repatriated as Inspector (BPS -16) to his p arent department on 25.04.2014, which is also reproduced as below: - “GOVERNMENT OF GILGIT -BALTISTAN THE DEPARTMENT OF SERVICES AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATION GILGIT -BALTISTAN SECRETARIAT, GILGIT.

He further submits that the deputationist cannot be adjusted and merged into regular service within two months against any vacant post depriving the incumbents/officers of police department waiting for their promotion thereto. 

While saying so he relied upon various reported judgment of the Hon‟bl e Supreme Court of Pakistan which have already been mentioned in criminal petition No. 89/2011, contempt proceedings against the Chief Secretary Sindh & others (alongwith others dozen of clubbed petitions) reported as 2013 SCMR 1752. 

He particularly referr ed para-77,79 & para -175 of the said reported Judgment which are reproduced as under: - Para-77. 

Shahid Hussain Mahessar, who came on deputation from I.B in 2009. 

In 2011 though he was repatriated under the orders of the Court to I.B in his case the Sindh Government has furnished comments stating therein that in the year 2009 his services were placed at the disposal of Sindh Government and he was posted as ADIGP/Special Branch Sindh, Karachi. 

He was recommended for absorption by Addle. 

AID/Special Branch Si ndh. 

In the year 2011 vide Notification dated 4.1.2011 his deputation was cancelled/withdrawn. 

He filed a Constitutional Petition in the High Court of Sindh and obtained status -quo order. 

Thereafter the said officer was appointed and transferred as SP (BPS -19) in Sindh Police on 11.10.2011.

He was appointed as DSP. 

How ever, in the year 2011 he was recommended for absorption in Police Department. 

IN his case, the Sindh Government in its comments has stated that at the desire of Chief Minister Sindh his services were placed at the disposal of Sindh Government in 2008 for a period of three years. 

Thereafter he was posted in Sind h Police. 

His case was placed before a Committee for absorption in Sind h Police. 

His Notification of absorption was cancelled/withdrawn. 

How ever, he filed Constitutional petition before Sindh High Co urt wherein his order of repatriation was suspended and he was allowed to continue in Sind h Police till further orders.

Applications and hold that the impugned legislations mentioned in pare -115 are violative of the provisions of the Constitution discussed hereinabove. 

We further hold and declare that benefit of “absorption” extended by the Sindh Government since 1994, with or without backdated seniority, are declared ultra vires of the Constitution, as the learned Additional Advocate General had made a statement during hearing that the im pugned validation instruments have granted legal cover to the employees/civil servants, who were absorbed since 1994. 

Likewise, we further hold and declare that all out of turn promotions made under section 9 -A of the Sindh Civil Servants Act, 1973, by t he Sindh Government to an employee or civil servant with or without backdated seniority since 22.01.2002 where section 9 -A was inserted through Ordinance IV of 2002, are ultra vires of the Constitution. 

All Misc applications made by the absorbees in which interim order were passed by this Court dated 20.05.2012 stand vacated. 

We also hold that all the re -employment/re -hiring of the retired civil Government Servants under the impugned instrument being violative of the constitution are declared nullity. 

We fu rther direct that the nominations made by the Chief Minister in exercise of the quota given by Rule 5(4)(b) of the West Pakistan Civil Service (Executive Branch) Rules, 1964, are without lawful authority and all the 15 nominees (Assistant Commissioners) ar e reverted to their original positions”. 10. 

The learned counsel for the petitioners further submits that the respondent No. 07 in collusion with the administration of Gilgit -Baltistan Government high ups and due to political influence successfully maneu vered illegally absorbing himself in police department in the next grade BPS -17 as DSP in regular police department. 

He further submits that after disposing Writ Petition No. 42/2009 and Writ petition No. 127/2014 by the learned Chief Court, he has managed and maneuvered not to file the appeal against the said impugned judgment s. 

The petitioners were not impleaded deliberately so that he may achieve his goal in designed manners. 

He prays that both the impugned judgments be set aside as the same are not sust ainable. 

He also repeated that in past Writ Petition No. 42/2009 was filed by police Inspectors namely Mr.

He further submits that it was arrayed in the light of established rule that the respondent No. 07 was not eligible for transfer to GB police who was serving as inspecto r in BPS -16 in Airport Security Force. 

He also submits that the notification of the respondent No. 07 was also unlawful being contrary to the provisions of Federal Government Deputation Rules 1993. 

It is also contended that in the said petition by the peti tioners/Inspectors of Police department that the functioning and the set up of the police department Northern Areas are Governed by Punjab Police Rules 1934 which have formally been extended to Northern Areas vide Notification dated 30.07.1978 and as provi ded in appendix -12.1 of the said Rules wherein not more than 20% of vacancies will be filled in by direct recruitment and remaining 80% posts will be filled through promotion from amongst the inspectors. 

However, the learned Chief Court upon hearing vide judgment dated 12.04.2012, the petition of the police Inspectors was dismissed holding that since the respondent No. 07 has already been adjusted against the said post under 50% direct quota as such no service rights of the police Inspectors/petitioners ha ve been jeopardized.

The learned counsel for the petitioners reiterated that it was provided under the Estacode that a person, who is transferred and appointed on deputation must be a government servant, and such transfer should be made through the process of selection. 

The borrowing government has to establish the exigency in the first place and then the person who is being trans ferred/placed on deputation in Government must have matching qualifications and expertise in the field with required experience. 

In absence of these conditions, the Government cannot appoint anyone by transfer or deputation. 

He also contends that Locus poe nitentiae is the power of receding till a decisive step is taken, but it is not a principle of law that order once passed becomes irrevocable and past and closed transaction. 

If the order is illegal, then perpetual rights cannot be gained on the basis of a n illegal order. 

He further submits that the respondent No. 07 maneuvered himself adjusted in BPS -17 on the clear post of DSP without application of the criteria laid down in law by way of underhand means or by any mode other than merit, cannot get protect ion of such benefit on the principle of locus poenitentiae, unless he could show that the benefit avail by him was in accordance with law, in good faith and without any ulterior motives of mala fide. 

While submitting so he relied upon case of Farhat Abbas versus I -G and others (2009 SCMR 245) relates to the out of tern promotion in the Police Department. 

The order was recalled by the authority assigning valid reasons to differentiate and to follow the parameters of reward on

============================================================

============================================================

16 account of bravery and gallantry as well as appreciation for performance of duty diligently but with due regard to the extent of such appreciation to commensurate with the degree of merit involved. 

Undoubtedly performance of duty with due diligence and efficiently deserves due appreciati on but it cannot be over appreciated out of proportion so as to make out case a grievance to the other employees in service of the department. 

If a case of glaring favouritism is made out resulting in a malafide action as in the instant matter, it has to b e rectified in accordance with law to avoid any injustice. 

Such a valid order cannot be set aside merely on conjectures or surmises as such practice would encourage a person to obtain any order using underhand means or otherwise and then claims immunity fo r such acts which would, therefore, result in rewarding the person using such means by allowing him to continue to enjoy fruits of such ill -gotten gains thus, perpetuate injustice. 

He also submits that the deputationists were not qualified to hold the posts against which they were working. 

He continues his argument while stating that the Government shall refrain from issuing posting orders of any non -cadre officer to a cadre post by transfer under Section 10 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 nor shall it depute by transfer any officer from occupational group of the Federal Government or from autonomous body in the Government except in exigency unless the deputationist meets the criteri a of matching qualifications, eligibility and experience to the proposed post. 

He further submits that the absorption of respondent No. 07

============================================================

============================================================

17 in higher grade in police department reflects political consideration as he cannot be absorbed within thirty nine (39 ) days against the rules, law and merit. 

He also contends that the constitution of Pakistan provides protection to every citizen to life and liberty. 

The term “life and liberty” used in this Article is very significant as it covers all the facets of human existence. 

The term life has not been defined in the Constitution, but it does not mean nor can it be restricted only to the vegetative or animal life or mere existence from conception to death. 

The inhabitation against its deprivation extends to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed. 

The term “life” includes „reputation‟ „status‟ and all other ancillary privileges which the law confers on the citizen. 

He submits that a civil servant is fully protected under Article 9 of the Constitution who cannot be deprived of his right of reputation, status and opportunity of the promotions in next grade. 

He lastly submits that the absorption of the respondent No. 07 who was serving as Inspector BPS -16 in Airport Security Force cannot be absorbed in a higher grade on deputation depriving other Police Officers/petitioners in line under Section 10 of Civil Servants Act, 1973 but he can be posted in a higher grade foe a period of three years on temporary basis. 

Such absorption within thirty nine (39) days after assuming charge on deputation would not only be unconstitutional without undertaking competitive and transparent process but would also deprive the seniority and progression of career of the meritorious Police Inspectors/petitioners. 

He submits

============================================================

============================================================

18 that the illegal absorption passed by Gilgit -Baltistan Government not a perpetual right of the respondent No. 07 gained on the basis of an illegal order. 

He prays that both the judgments in Writ Petition No. 42/2009 and 127 /2014 passed by Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan be set aside being not sustainable. 13. 

On the other han d, the learned counsel for the respondent No. 07 submits that the impugned judgment dated 11.03.201 5 in Writ Petition No. 127/2014, passed by the learned Chief Court is well founded and in accordance with the service rules and law, which has rightly been passed by the learned Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan. 

He further submits that the petitioner was a permanent employee in the A irport Security Force in BPS -16 and he was performing his duties efficiently. 

Later on his services were transferred to Gilgit - Baltistan Police on deputation basis for three years and subsequently, he has been absorbed in Gilgit -Baltistan Police on permanent footing correctly in line with the service/deputation rules and there is no embargo to absorb a deputationist on permanent basis against a clear vacant post of Deputy Superintendent of Police. 

He supports the impugned j udgment, which according to him has been passed rightly and no interference is warranted in to it to meet the ends of justice. 

He also referred the judgment passed in Writ Petition No. 42/2009 filed by the five Inspectors of Police wherein the absorption of the respondent No. 07 was challenged. 

The learned Chief Court was

============================================================

19 pleased to dismiss the same being meritless and absorption of the respondent No. 07 was held in accordance with law which holds the field. 13. 

We have heard both the learned counsel s for the respective parties at length, perused the record and gone through the impugned Judgment in Writ Petition No. 42/2009 and Writ Petition No. 127/2014, passed by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan and the impugned Notification dated 25.04.2014 issued by the respondent No. 01 as well as the case law relied upon by the learned counsel for t he petitioners. 

The case law s referred by the learned counsel for the petitioners support his contentions. 

In our considered view the absorption of respondent No. 07 was illegal, without lawful authority and ultra vires to the service laws and rules which is not tenable. 

Consequently, we accepted the appeal vide our short order dated 31.03.2016 and set aside both the impugned judgment dated 12.04.2011 in Writ Petition No. 42/2009 and judgment dated 11.03.2015 in Writ Petition No. 127/2014, passed by the learned Chief Cour t Gilgit -Baltistan. 

Consequent thereto, the impugned Notification No. 

SO(S) –I-2(39)/2013, dated 25.04.2014 issued by the respondent No. 01 was maintained. 

The respondent no. 07 Mr. 

Babar khan was directed to report to his parent Department i.e. 

Airport Se curity Force forthwith. 

Consequently, the connected petition i.e. 

CPLA No. 18/2016, titled Babar Khan versus Tahira Yasub & others was dismissed and the
