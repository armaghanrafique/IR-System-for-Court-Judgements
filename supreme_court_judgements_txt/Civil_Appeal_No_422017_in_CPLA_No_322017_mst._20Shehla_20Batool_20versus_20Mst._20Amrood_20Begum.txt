Briefly the facts of the case are that the respondent s filed a Civil Suit No. 46/2016 for declaratio n etc alongwith an application for temporary injunction under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC in the Court of learned Civil Judge Astore. 

Upon hearing the learned Trial Court dismissed the application for temporary injunction vide order dated 08.12.2016 which was upheld by the learned First Appellate Court Astore vide judgment dated 22.12.2016. 

The respondents being aggrieved preferred Civil Revision No. 12/2017 before the learned Chief Court which was allowed, hence, this petition for leave to appeal. 3.

3 vide order dated 08.12.2016 which was upheld by the learned First Appell ate Court Astore vide judgment dated 22.12.2016. 

The respondents being aggrieved preferred Civil Revision No. 12/2017 before the learned Chief Court which was allowed. 

Per learned counsel the learned Chief Court fell in error while passing the said impugne d order, hence, the same is not tenable and liable to be set aside. 

He prays that the impugned order dated 16.02.2017 in Civil Revision No. 12/2017 passed by the learned Chief Court may graciously be set aside to meet the ends of justice. 4. 

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondents supports the impugned order dated 16.02.2017 in Civil Revision No. 12/2017 passed by the learned Chief Court. 

He contends that since the eligibility of the petitioners has to be determined by the learned Trial Court, therefore, it is essential that the appointments of the petitioners be restrained in order to avoid any financial loss to the Government exchequer in case of non - eligibility of the petitioners for the said post s on the basis of their Permanent Residence Certificate (PRC). 

Per learned counsel the impugned order dated 16.02.2017 in Civil Revision No. 12/2017 passed by the learned Chief Court is well reasoned and well founded being passed in accordance with law and facts of the case, hence, the same is required to be maintained. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned order dated 16.02.2017 in Civil Revision No.

4 12/2017 passed by the learned Chief Court. 

Admittedly, not only the petitioners have been adversely affected but also the academic activities of the school have been disturbed due to non -availability of teachers by reversing the impugned order dated 16.02.20 17 in Civil Revision No. 12/2017 passed by the learned Chief Court. 

The Government Functionaries can not be stopped to pass the administrative orders in order to run the affairs of school in public interest at large. 6. 

In view of the above discussions, we convert this petition into an appeal and the same is allowed. 

Consequently, the impugned order dated 16.02.2017 in Civil Revision No. 12/2017 passed by the learned Chief Court is set aside by maintaining the concurrent findings of the two Courts below. 7. 

The appeal is allowed in above terms.
