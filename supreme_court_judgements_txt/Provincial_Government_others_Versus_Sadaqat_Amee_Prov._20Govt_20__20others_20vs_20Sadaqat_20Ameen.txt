The learned Advocate General submits that the respondents were never a ppointed in the posts of Computer Operators BPS -12 and they have no locus standi to file the writ petition in the Chief Court. 

He also submits that they were appointed on contract basis till regularization of their contractual services. 

Per learned Advocat e General, after issuance of notification of re-designation of the said posts, the services of the respondents was regularized in the posts of Data Entry Operators (DEO) BPS -12 vide Office order No. 

Est(T) -1(2)/2014 dated 26.03.2015. 

He adds that the act of creation of posts on need basis, allocation posts on area basis and recruitment in the posts under rules is internal basis of the petitioners. 

The respondents have no right of interference over official work of petitioners. 

He reiterates that no illegal or without authority act was committed by petitioners while regularizing the contingent/contr act services of the respondents and they have no vested right to challenge the notification dated 17.01.2014 through writ petition. 

He submits that the learned Ch ief Court fell in error while passing the impugned judgment dated 19.09.2017. 

He submits that the said impugned judgment is the result of mis -interpretation of law and misreading/non -reading of the facts of the case and the same is not sustainable. 

He pray s that the said impugned judgment may graciously be set aside to meet the ends of justice. 3. 

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondents supports the impugned judgment passed by the

3 learned Chief Court. 

He contends that the posts of Comput er Operators BPS -12 in the Tourism Department were re -designated as Data Entry Operators BPS -12 was based on malafide intentions as the existing posts of Computer Operator BPS -12 had already been up -graded from BPS -12 to BPS -16 by the Government of Gilgit -Baltistan vide Notification dated 27.05.2010. 

Per learned counsel, the discriminatory re -designation of the already up -graded posts of Computer Operators from BPS -12 to BPS -16 into BPS -12 results frustration among the respondents. 

The respondents may be treated equally among equals. 

He submits that the learned Chief Court has rightly accepted the writ petition filed by the respondents vide impugned judgment dated 19.09.2017. 

He prays that the said impugned judgment may pleased be maintained being well reasoned and well founded. 4. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court. 

In our considered view, the impugne d judgment dated 19.09.2017 passed by the learned Chief Court is not well reasoned and well founded, hence, interference into it is warranted. 5. 

In view of the above discussions, we convert this petition into an appeal and the same is allowed. 

Consequent ly, the impugned judgment dated 19.09.2017 in Writ Petition No. 118/2016 passed by the learned Chief Court is set aside.
