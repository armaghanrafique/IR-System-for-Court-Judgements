The State r/o Bonor voluntarily appeared before this Court and submitted that he has voluntary, with free will and in the name of Almighty Allah has pardon ed/forgiven the petitioners. 

On the basis of compromise and statement of the complainant at bar, the learned counsel for the petitioners prays for their acquittal and release from Jail. 3. 

In view of the compromise based on free will and voluntariness, quantum of sentence awarded as well as observations made by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the following judgments, we are inclined to accept the submissions of the learned counsel for release of the petitioner from Jail and his acquittal from the charges as well. 

While acquitting the petitioners from the charges, we are fortified by the observations of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in such cases. 

The relevant case laws are quoted below: SUO MOTU CASE Re VS State P L D 2018 Supreme Court 703 Carrying the spirit of composition (forgiveness and reconciliation) forward we may add that grant of the requisite permission or leave by the court in such cases should be a rule and its withholding or refusal an exception. 

Composition of a compoundable offence is a co ncession extended by the legislature and also by the religion of Islam to the victims and their heirs and the same may not lightly be taken away or whittled down by the courts. 17.As a result of the discussion made above we declare the legal position as fo llows: (i) As provided by the provisions of section 338 -E(1), P.P.C. and the first proviso to the same and as already declared by this Court in the case of Chairman Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan and another v. 

Mumtaz Khan (PLD 2010 SC 695) as a result of a successful and complete compounding of a compoundable offence in a case of Ta'zir under section 345, Cr.P.C., with permission or leave of the relevant court where required, an accused person or convict is to be acquitted by the relevant court which acquittal shall erase, efface, obliterate and wash away his alleged or already adjudged guilt in the matter apart

The State from leading to setting aside of his sentence or punishment, if any. (ii) In the context of the provisions of section 345(6), Cr.P.C. th e effect of an acquittal recorded by a court on the basis of a successful and complete compounding of a compoundable offence shall include all the benefits and fruits of a lawful acquittal. 

Naseer Ahmed Vs. 

The State 2011 SCMR 1292 “3. 

All the legal hei rs of the deceased on the basis of the compromise arrived at between the respective parties have forgiven the appellants/convicts in the name of Almighty Allah and have already sworn affidavits. 

The major legal heirs have deposed before the learned Session s Judge that they have entered into a compromise and have forgiven the appellants/convicts, therefore, have no objection if the Criminal Appeal No. 312 of 2004 is accepted and the appellants be acquitted from the charge. 4.In the light of the foregoing rea sons, facts and circumstances, Cr.M.A. 

No. 372 of 2008 is allowed and Criminal Appeal No. 312 of 2004 is disposed of in terms of compromise. 

The appellants are acquitted from the charge and shall be released forthwith if not required in any other case ” Muhammad Irshad Alias Shada Vs State 1997 SCMR 951 “3. 

We are convinced that th e compromise between the legal heirs of the deceased and the petitioner accused is genuine. 

The composition of an offence under section 302, P.P.C by the legal heirs of the deceased shall have the effect of acquittal of the accused with whom the offence has been compounded” 2017 SCMR 1990 Waheed and other Vs. 

The State and others “Having perused the afore -mentioned report of the District and Sessions Judge, Pakpattan, we find that the compromise effected between the parties is genuine, voluntary and without a ny coercion or duress. 

In view of the above, Crl. 

M.A. 

No. 312 -L of 2017 filed by Waheed convict -applicant is allowed. 

Consequently, Jail Petition No. 477 of 2015 filed by convict -applicant is converted into an app eal and the same is allowed. 

The impugned judgment of the learned High Court dated 16.09.2015 is set aside. 

The appellant Waheed is acquitted of the charge and shall be released forthwith, if not required to be detained in any other case”
