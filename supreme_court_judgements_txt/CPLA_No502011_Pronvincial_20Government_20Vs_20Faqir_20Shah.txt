2 2 the res pondent No. 03 i.e. the Director Education Gilgit -Baltistan for construction of High School in Jalal -abad Tehsil and District Gilgit which was adjacent to the land of two others persons near main road. 

He further submitted that at the time of acquiring of land the Revenue Field Staff assessed the price of the land of the petitioner and one Syed Muhamad Hussain @ Rs. 60000/ - per kanal whereas, the land at the adja cent land of one Ghullam Jan and Ibrahim Shah was assessed @ Rs. 1,20,000/ - per kanal inspite o f the fact that all the lands are adjacent to each others and situated at the same plac e have said potential value yet the price of the land of the petitioner was less assessed. 

He further submits that the petitioner has filed a reference under Section 18 of Land Acquisition Act before the Land Acquisition Judge, who consequently, pleased to grant relief to the petitioners partially and dismissed the reference. 

The petitioner being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the order of the learned Land Acquisi tion Judge filed appeal before the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan on 20.09.2011. 

Upon hearing the learned chief Court Gilgit - Baltistan vide impugned judgment/order dated 20.09.2011 in CFA No. 21/2006 granted partial relief to the petitioner to the exte nt of compound interest from the date of acquiring the land i.e. with effect from 1980 to till the date of possession i.e. 2005 and declined to enhance the rate of the land of the petitioner as prayed.

Finally he prayed that he may be compensated equal ly amongst the equals. 2. 

On the other hand, the learned Advocate General GB on behalf of the respondent No. 1 to 3 in the instant petition and a connected appeal No. 

CPLA 01/2012 on behalf of the Provincial Government being petitioner contended that t he impugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan in CFA No. 21 /2006 dated 20.09.2012 and the judgment passed in Reference No. 03/2006 dated 28.10.2006 passed by the Refree Judge, as both are illegal and unjustified and according to him, the same are liable to set aside. 

He further submits that in the year 1980 on the demand of the people of Jalalabad a Boys High School has been established at Jalalabad Tehsil and District Gilgit. 

For this purpose the barren land 05 Kanals 02 Marlas of the petitioner was included as he gifted the same for school. 

Provision of land for construction of school was undertaken by the School Committee themselves with the demand that employment of grade -1 in the school shall be given to the person who donat ed land for the school. 

He furth er added that the barren land measuring 05 Kanals 02 M arlas was provided by Faqir Shah as gifted to the School in collusion with the Revenue Field Staff succeeded in including his name /gifted barren property, in the award and after being paid compen sation, filed the Reference Petition under Section 18 of Land Acquisition Act, for enhancement of rate of compensation.

4 4 objection s against the award of the Collector except the petitioner who despite of obtaining employment and compensation filed Reference Petition in the Court against the award dated 28.06.1997, the same reference was partially accepted against which, he filed appeal in the Chief Court. 

In the impugned judgment dated 20.06.2011 by modifying the judgment of Referee Court i.e. the compound interest be paid to the petitioner w.e.f. 01.01.1980 till 13.05.2005 instead of 28.06.1997 to 13.05.2005. 3. 

We have heard both the learned counsels for the petitioners as well as the respondents, perused the record and gone through the impugned judgments of both the Courts below. 

In our considered view the arguments advanced by the learned Advocate General GB has force, as the petitioner namely Faq ir Shah donated land measuring 05 (Five) K anals and 02 (two) Marlas from his barren land for the construction of School at Jalalabad Gilgit and in lieu thereof he was compensated as agreed by giving employment to him in Grade -01 in the said School. 

He further submitted that the petitioner in CPLA No.50/2011 and respondent in CPLA No.01/2012, subsequently, he manovered and succeeded with the collusion of Revenue Field Staff obtained award and compensation thereto of his barren land admeasuring 04 (four) Kanals and 11 (eleven) Marlas @ Rs. 60,000/ - per Kanal. 4. 

In view of the above, both the petitions i.e. 51/2011 filed by the petitioner Faqir Shah and the civil Petition No. 01/2012 filed by the Provincial Government etc are converted into appeals and
