impugned judgment/order passed by the learned Chief Court Gilgit - Baltistan, the petitioner filed the instant petition for leave to appeal before this court. 

The learned counsel for petitioner submits that due to an administrative order passed by the learned Registrar of Chief Court in which the case of petitioner was sent to the learned Service Tribunal Gilgit -Baltistan for disposal in accordance with law. 

Since the matter pertains to contract services, and the case does not come with in the purview of the learned Service Tribunal, which through an administrative order returned back eighty five (85) cases including the case of petitioner to the learned Chief Court with the request to dispose off the said case in accordance with law. 

On 03.03.2015 the matter was taken up by the learned Division Bench of Chief Court who was pleased to dismiss the case of petitioner being time barred. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the time consumed due to administrative orders passed b y the learned Registrar of Chief Court as well as the learned Service Tribunal through Registrar and it cannot be counted against the petitioner. 

He further submits that the impugned order passed by the learned Chief Court was not tenable and liable to set aside. 

The learned Advocate General frankly conceded that the learned Chief Court should have to hear the case and decide it on merits in accordance with law. 

He, however, lukewarmly supported the contensions raised by the learned counsel for the petit ioner.
