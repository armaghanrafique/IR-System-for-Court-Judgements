Upon hearing the suit in question was dis missed vide judgment/decree dated 30.09.2012 which was subsequently upheld by the learned First Appellate Court vide judgment dated 17.05.2014.

3 the learned Chief Court did not consider the afor ementioned facts while passing the impugned order dated 16.09.2016 and has wrongly reversed the concurrent findings of the learned two Courts below. 

He contends that the impugned order is the result of misreading and mis -appreciation of evidence and material on record. 

He prays that the impugned order passed by the learned Chief Court may graciously be set aside. 4. 

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent supports the impugned order passed by the learned Chief Court.

Zainaba in favour of the petitioners. 

He also contends that the possession is also disputed between the parties and both the parties claim that the property in question is in their possession. 

Since, the possession of the suit land i.e. about 4/5 Kanals in dispute. 

Consequently, t he learned Trial Court appointed 03 receivers namely Fida Ali, Rajab Ali and Shaban Ali r/o pisan Nagar to receive income of the property in question and the said income be deposited in court accordingly. 

He further contends that the possession of the disp uted land has been proved from the statement s of Shaban Ali and Nawroz who stated that the possession of the said land is with the respondent.

4 16.09.2016 may pleased be maintained being well reasoned and well founded. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned order pa ssed by the learned Chief Court, the judgment dated 17.05.2014 in Civil First Appeal No. 31/2013 passed by the learned District Judge Hunza -Nagar and judgment/decree dated 30.09.2012 in C ivil Suit No. 01/1996 passed by the learned Civil Judge 1st Class Gilgit. 

In our considered view, the impugned order dated 16.09.2016 in Civil Revision No. 60/2014 passed by the learned Chief Court is the result of mis - appreciation of the evidence and other material on record which is not sustainable whereas the concurrent findings of the learned Courts below are well reasoned and well founded. 

The petitioners have successfully proved issue No. 10 by producing documentary as well as oral evidence which have rightly been appreciated by the learned two Courts below. 

In view of the above discussions, we convert this petition into an appeal and the same is allowed. 

Consequently, the impugned order dated 16.09.2016 in Civil Revision No. 60/2014 passed by the le arned Chief Court is set aside. 

The concurrent findings of the learned two Courts below are maintained.
