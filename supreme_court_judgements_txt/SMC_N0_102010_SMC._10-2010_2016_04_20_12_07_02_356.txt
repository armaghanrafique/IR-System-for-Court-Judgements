SUPREME APPELLATE COURT GILGIT -BALTISTAN (Original Jurisdiction) S.M.C. 

NO. 10/2010 COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE OVER FLOW AT HOTO SKARDU Present: Mr. 

Justice Muhammad Nawaz Abbasi, C.J. 

Advocate General Gilgit -Baltistan Deputy Commissioner Skardu. 

Date of hearing: 30 -03-2011 JUDGMENT Muhammad Nawaz Abbasi, CJ: In pursuance of an application moved by effectees of village Hoto Pakora and Hoto Ranga Tehsil Gamba, Skardu through Haji Muhammad Rafique and another, direction was given to learned District and Sessions Judge Skardu for holding an inquiry into the matter and learned sessio ns Judge submitted report as under: - “On 29.07.2010 the Honorable Chief Judge was on a Private visit to Skardu when the people of villages Hoto Pakora and Hoto Range Tehsil Gamba Skardu presented an application. 

The Honorable Chief Judge assigned the application to undersigned with the following remarks on the said application: - “SESSIONS JUDGE SKARDU MAY SUBMIT A DETAILED REPORT ON THE GRIEVANCES OF THE APPLICANTS AND ALSO PROPOSE APPROPRIATE MANNER FOR REDRESSAL THEREOF”. 

Undersigned directe d the applicants to appear in the court. 

Applicants stated that the Administration has prepared lists of damages caused to their properties through Mr. 

Muhammad Arif Acting Tehsildar Gamba Skardu. 

Undersigned summoned the said Tehsildar also and obtained A nnexure -A, comprised of seven (07) pages showing detailed report of compensation with detail of damages caused to the different villagers of the two villages. 

Petitioners expressed their dissatisfaction on annexure -A and on my directions presented Annexure -B as their own estimates of compensation. 

Undersigned have recorded joint statement of petitioners (Annexure -C). 

Recently petitioners and the Acting Tehsildar Gamba Skardu appeared in the court, on their own and jointly reported

that Government/Administ ration has included the flood effectees of the villagers of petitioner’s villages with the flood effectees of Qumrah Skardu. 

Qumrah Skardu is a village where about 70 persons were died in the flood diva stations. 

So undersigned proposes for questioning the petitioners about most recent position before passing any order on the petition because petitioners appeared a bit satisfied on their inclusion with flood effectees of village Qumrah. 

So the petition in hand is a very simple petition. 

The grievances of the petitioners raised in the petition are: (i) Orders be passed for payment of compensation amounts of the damages to lands and trees of the petitioners caused through soil erusion by f looded water. (ii) Orders be passed for construction of protective Bund. (iii) International experts be arranged for estimating future damages. 

Relief (i). 

The administration has been preparing estim ates of damages caused to the properties of petitioners. 

In their statement petitioners have stated that the damages to the petitioners properties are being caused by the flooded river almost every year and administration regularly prepares estimates of da mages, so caused by the river. 

But so far the administration did not pay any compensation amounts for such damages. 

In this connection administration is the proper forum for preparation of such estimates and courts do not have any mechanism to p repare such estimates. 

If petitioners are not satisfied with preparation of such estimates through any particular officer or officers of the administration, petitioners are free to approach higher authorities of administration for changing such officer or officers. 

Moreover the administration who are responsible for such preparation of estimates of such damages are the relevant persons who have the record of landed properties of petitioners, therefore are in a better position to prepare such papers. 

Relief (ii) Your honor may ask/direct the administration for construction of a protective Bund to save the petitioners’ landed properties form routine damages of flooded water of the river. 

Anyhow, the administration of such protective Bund if the same is techni cally feasible and such protective Bund must not be causing damages to any other village. 

Relief (iii) This relief appears baseless as we do not have any scarcity of experts in our country. 

Report is submitted as desired please. 

Dated: 28.09.2010. -sd-
