Briefly the facts of t he case are th at the petitioner belongs to District Hunza of Gilgit -Baltistan and he was also the Vice Chairman of Pak -China Sost Port Company (Pvt) Ltd and member of Board of Trustees of Silk Route Dry Port Trust. 

A loan was sanctioned amounting to Rs. 50 million s to the aforementioned Trust through National Bank of Pakistan Sost Branch. 

The Bank later on alleged that the petitioner had got sanctioned the above referred loan on the basis of fraud and forgery. 

Consequently, the Bank proceeded against the petitioner and 0 8 others by filing a Civil Suit in the Banking Court/Chief Court for recovery of Rs. 58544918/ - alongwith costs, expenses and cost of funds from the date of default until realization of entire amount by the way sale of the mortgaged property hypothecated g oods and other assets of the defendants. 

The FIA and NAB authorities initiated inquiries against the petitioner for his involvement in obtaining loan from bank fraudulently. 

The NAB authorities issued notice under Section 19 of the NAB Ordinance against t he petitioner. 

On the receipt of such notice the petitioner filed Writ Petition No. 82/2009 in the learned Chief Court/Banking Court praying therein to restrain the NAB authorities for such inquiries/investigations. 

The said petition was disposed of on the assurance of the Special Prosecutor NAB at Gilgit that no violation of the Section 31 -D of NAB Ordinance 1999 would be committed. 

Subsequently, the Civil Misc. 

No. 08/2012 was filed by the petitioner praying therein that the proceedings against the petitioner were in violation of the directives of this Court in Writ

3 Petition No. 82/2009 filed on 15.11.2010. 

The N AB authorities submitted that the investigation against the petitioner has been initiated on the basis of the allegations of fraud which does not attract the provisions of Section 31 -D of the NAB ordinance. 

Upon hearing, the Division Bench of the learned Chief Court pleased to hold that the NAB authorities cannot be restrained from the inquiries/ investigations for the allegations leveled against the petitioner which may cover the pre -requisite s provided for action and consequently the Misc Appeal was dismi ssed. 

Whereafter the petitioner filed Civil Review No. 77/2013 praying therein to set aside the impugned order dated 27.05.2013 to meet the ends of justice. 

The learned Chief Court upon hearing dismissed the same being meritless, hence, this Petition for L eave to Appeal. 3. 

The NAB authorities initiated inquiries vide Notice dated 08.01.2012 and sought information under Section 19 of the NAB Ordinance 1999 against the petitioner which is reproduced as under: - “Quote” Government of Pakistan National Accountability Bureau RMC Boys Hostel No. 3 Rawal Road Rawalpindi PH# 051 -9280841 Fax # 051 -9281132 No.6 ( 24)/FCIW/NAB( R)/2010 08 Jan, 2012.

4 Subject: - Investigation against Mr. 

Muhammad Arif SVP/RBC (Retired) NBP, Gilgit and others. 1. 

Whereas the presence of the aforesaid person is necessary for the purpose of inquir y into the offence reported to have been committed under National Accountability Ordinance, 1999, therefore, you are hereby directed to appear before Mr. 

Asad Mehmood Assistant Director /IO, FCIW NAB Rawalpindi at 1000 hours on 23rd January 2012 alongwith relevant record. 2. 

This notice is issued under Section 19 of NAO 1999, which provided that anyone who fails to provide information/record requisitioned or knowingly provides false information/record or refuses to answer the question s shall be liable for prosecution under NAO 1999. -Sd- Imran Majeed Asstt. 

Dir (Coord) FCIW. “Unquote ” 4. 

The lea rned counsel for the petitioner contends that a Civil Suit for recovery filed by the National Bank of Pakistan on the same subject which preclude the NAB to entertain the complaint of NBP and to investigate or conduct inquiry against the petitioner. 

He also contends that it is a case of double jeopardy as no one can be vexed twice for the same offence. 

He further contends that NAB authorities cannot initiate inquiry/investigation in absence of the approval from the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan as provided under Section 31 -D of NAB Ordinance 1999 ). 5. 

He also submits tha t the impugned judgment /order dated 25.11.2014 as well as the judgment dated 27.05.2013 passed by the learned Chief Court are the result of misconception of law and misreading of the facts of the case, hence, the same are not tenable and required to be set aside to meet the ends of justice. 

The

============================================================

============================================================

5 said judgments of the Chief Court are contradictory to its own un reported judgment passed in a similar nature case i.e. 

Qalb Ali etc versus The State through NAB. 

While submitting so he supports his contentions by r elying upon case laws reported as (2010 PCr.LJ, 13), (2005 PLD, Lahore 692), (PLD 2001 Karachi, 419), (PLD 2001 SC, 60) and ( NCR 2003, Criminal 361. 6. 

On the other hand the learned Additional Deputy Prosecutor General for NAB at Gilgit and Mr. 

Muhamm ad Hussain Shehzad learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No. 02 M/s National Bank of Pakistan submit that the Review Petition No. 77/2013 was filed by the petitioner in the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court to defeat the investigation proces s initiated by the NAB authorities in order to unearth the truth and punish to the fraudsters. 

They sub mit that no fundamental right, if any, of the petitioner has been infringed by any authority including NAB. 

The process of inquiry/investigation cannot be prohibited/precluded by exercising the extraordinary jurisdiction of the Courts. 

They further submit that prime facie, the petitioner have committed offences under section 9 of NAB Ordinance 1999 which can only be determined after conducting inquiry/investigation. 

They fur ther submit that the petitioner was Vice Chairman of Pak -China Sost Port Company Private Limited and being Member of Board of Trustees of Si lk Rout Dry Port Trust has remain involved in getting unlawful loans and filing of a recovery suit by the National Bank of Pakistan does not exempt the petitioner from the

============================================================

============================================================

6 inquiry/investigation initiated by the NAB. 

The noti ce issued by the respondents ha s been issued under Section 9 of NAB Ordinance 1999, whereby any person involved can be investigated for the offences mentioned therein. 

The filing of recovery suit does not amount to double jeopardy. 

In case the authorities empowered under the law are of the opinion that any matter is required to be inquired or investigated they cannot be restrained on the excuse of filing of recovery suit. 

They contend that under Section 9 of NAB Ordinance, no exemption has been granted to any class of people. 

Accordingl y Section 31 -D of NAB Ordinance has been provided for the purpose of imprudent loans but never restrict the scope of Section 9 of the said Ordinance which is purely meant for the corruption and corrupt practice falling under that provision of law. 

Consequ ently, the petition being groundless was dismissed by the Chief Court. 

They further submit that Review Petition was not maintainable which was filed just to gain time and to frustrate the process of inquiries/investigations initiated by NAB. 

The learned Chief Court has rightly dismissed the same. 7. 

They finally submit that the impugned judgment/ Order dated 25.11.2014 in Review Petition No. 77/2013 and the Order dated 27.05.2013 in Civil Misc No. 08/2012 passed by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan are well reasoned and well founded, hence, no interference is warranted thereto. 

While submitting so they relied upon the case laws reported as (2009 SCMR 335) and (PLD 2009 Karachi 469).

We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned judgment/ order dated 25.11.2014 in Review Petition. 

No. 77/2013 and the Order dated 27.05.2013 in Civil Misc No. 08/2012 passed by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan as well as the case laws relied upon by the learned counsels for the respective parties. 9. 

We have also gone through the provisions of Sections 18 and 19 of the NAB Ordinance 1999 which are reproduced as under: - “Section 18. 

Cognizance of offences: - (a)……. (b) A reference under this Ordinance shall be initiated by the National Accountability Bureau on…. (i). a reference received from the appropriate government; or (ii). 

Receipt of a complaint; or (iii). its own record. (c)………… (d) The responsibility for inquiry into an investigation of an offence alleged to have been committed under this Ordinance shall rest on the NAB to the exclusion of any other agency or authority, unless any such agency or authority is required to do so by the Chai rman (NAB) or by an officer of the NAB duly authorized by him. (e). the Chairman NAB and such members, officers the learned Advocate -on-Record servants of the NAB shall have and exercise, for the purpose of an inquiry or investigation the power to arrest a ny person, and all the powers of an officer in -charge of Police Station under the Code, and for that purpose may cause the attendance of any person, and when and if the assistance of any agency, Police officer or any other official or agency shall render s uch assistance provided that no person shall be arrested without the permission of the Chairman (NAB) or any officer (of NAB) duly authorized by the Chairman NAB. 10. 

The plain reading of Sub Section (e) of Section 18 of the ordinance insists that for purpose of an inquiry or investigation, the officer so inquiring /investigating shall have all the powers as are available with officer –in-charge of a police station unde r the code, which are so provided under Chapter XIV of the Criminal Procedure

============================================================
PAGE 8
============================================================

8 Code. 

Needless to add here that Chapter XIV of the Cr. 

PC also includes the Section 160 to 1 64 Cr.PC which deal with power to require attendance, recording of statement. 

Since f rom the bare reading of Section 18(b) of the ordinance it becomes clear that an inquiry /investigation could be initiated only by the Chairman or an officer of the NAB, duly authorized by him, thus the officer, so authorized for conducting such an inquiry /investigation, shall enjoy all powers as are available to an officer -in-Charge of a police Station within meaning of the Chapter XIV of the Criminal Procedure Code. 

Section 19. 

Power to call information … the Chairman NAB (an of the NAB duly authorized by him) may, during the course of inquiry or investigation of an offence under this ordinance or any rule or order made thereunder: - (a). 

Call for information from any person for the purpose of satisfying himself whether there has been any contravention of the provisions of this ordinance or any rule or order made thereunder; 11. 

A bare reading of the said provisions reveals that if an inquiry or investigation is ordered in respect of offence punishable under the Ordinance by Chairman N AB then during the course of the said inquiry or investigation of such offence any officer duly authorized by Chairman is competent to call for information from any person for the purpose of Satisfying himself whether there has been any contravention of th e provisions of the Ordinance or any rule or order made thereunder. 

Thus it is manifest that it empowers the authorized officer to examine any person acquainted with the facts and circumstance of the case. “Any Person” includes witnesses

============================================================
PAGE 9
============================================================

9 or an accused even. 

We are in complete agreement and acknowledge the legal position that one cannot be compelled to answer a question which can expose him to criminal charges and that one cannot be forced to be a witness which is so evident from the section 161 of the Code and Article 13 (2) of the Constitution. 

Both the said section and article are reproduced as under: - Section. 161. 

Examination of witness by Police …. (1) any Police officer making an investigation under this chapter or any Police Officer not below the rank as the Provincial Government may, by general or special order, prescribe in this behalf, acting on the requisition. 

Of such officer many examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and said circumstances of the case. (2) such pers on shall be bound to answer all questions relating to such case put to him by such officer, other than questions the answer to which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture. 

Article 13 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. 

No person…. (a)……………….. (b) Shall, when accused of an offence, be compelled to be a witness against himself. 

However, the criminal administration of justice demands that version of the accused should also come on record during the course of the investigation, therefore, above referred Article and provision shall not justify the Investigating Officer for non -examination of the accused nor shall disentitle him (Investigating Officer) from asking a question which he feels ne cessary for proper interrogation. 

This is the object because of which the word “examination” has been used with deliberation under this chapter. 12. 

Keeping in view the above touchstone, let’s examine whether call up notices impugned in this petition, p rime facie serves its purpose or otherwise. 

Perusal of the said notice and reflects that matter (inquiry being conducted) a reference as to for what purposed the examination and production of documents or

============================================================
PAGE 10
============================================================

10 necessary, is evident, therefore, call -up notices c annot said to be entirely illegal. 13. 

Without prejudice to the above, what would we like to make it clear that issuance of notice, even if found to be not within its purpose and object, yet a wrongly issued notice shall not, under any case, justify qua shing the route (an investigation, initiated under Section 18 (c) of the Ordinance ) or be taken as a sword to keep the prosecution out of its right to dig out truth for simple that an authorized officer (investigating Officer) was negligent of not issuin g notice properly. 

A mere irregularity or even illegality on the part of the Investigating Officer in following procedure within meaning Chapter XIV of the Criminal Procedure Code, shall not cost an offence to go un -attended because an irregularity or ille gality in procedure may be cured but not the impacts and effects of an offence if the same is let un -touched despite its being coming to light. 

The moment and offence is committed the effect thereof start but a procedural error, irregular and even illegal ity by Investigating Officer can well be judged by the competent Court toward the effects and consequences. 14. 

In view of the above discussions and the case laws relied upon by the learned Counsel for NAB and National Bank of Pakistan regional Office Gi lgit-Baltistan and in our considered view the NAB authorities cannot be precluded to issue call -up notices or restrain to conduct an inquiry/investigation under NAB Ordinance 1999. 

The case laws preferred by the lea rned Counsel for the

============================================================
PAGE 11
============================================================

11 petitioner is distin guishable whereas the case laws relied upon by the learned counsels for the respondents are applicable. 15. 

Consequently, we hold that the NAB authorities are lawfully authorized to conduct inquiry/investigate and interference into the authorities of th e NAB would seriously prejudice to the prosecution towards its right in probing into an investigation /inquiry of an offence. 

The learned counse l for the petitioner could not point out any illegality and infirmity in the impugned judgments/order. 

The impug ned judgment is well reasoned and well founded; therefore, no interference is warranted. 

Consequent thereto, we convert this petition into an appeal and the same is dismissed. 

The impugned judgment /Order dated 25.11.2014 in Civil Review No.77/201 3 and the judgment dated 11.09.2012 in Civil Misc No. 08/2012 passed by the learned Chief Court Gilgit - Baltistan are maintained. 16. 

The appeal is dismissed.
