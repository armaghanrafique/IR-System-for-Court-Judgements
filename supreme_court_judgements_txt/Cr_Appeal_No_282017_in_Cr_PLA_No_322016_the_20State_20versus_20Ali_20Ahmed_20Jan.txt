He submits that on the pointation of the accused the Investigating Officer (I.O) has visited the site of occurrence in presence of impartial witnesses which is a strong corroborative piece of evidence. 

The said piece of evidence is coupled with the confessional statement of the accused recorded under Sec tion 21 -H, the guilt against the accused is proved beyond any shadow of doubt. 

He submits that a 30 -bore pistol was also recovered by the police from the accused as weapon of offence which has been tested in laboratory and a positive report has been receiv ed which is another piece of supportive evidence against the accused.

The learned Advocate General reiterates that the judgment

============================================================

============================================================

6 dated 30.08.2014 passed by the learned Trial Court was based on material evidence on record whereas the impugned judgment dated 19.05.2016 passed by the learned Chief Court is the res ult of non - reading and misreading of the prosecution evidence. 

He submits that the accused has committed an offence of murder of one Ehsanullah (deceased). 

He prays that the judgment passed by the learned Trial Court may graciously be maintained as the imp ugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court is not sustainable. 8. 

The learned counsel for the respondent was not present inspite of notice issued and served upon him properly, hence, this case was heard in its own merits in accordance with law. 

The respondent is his pleadings contended that according to the prosecution the complainant was the eye witness of the occurrence and he was examined as PW -01. 

The PW -01 failed to substantiate the case because his statement did not involve the respondent. 

He further contended that before arresting the respondent, the Investigating Officer (I.O) was required to conduct identification parade of the respondent but failed to do so rather arrested the respondent as main accused on the basis of his own informatio n. 

Per the contentions of the respondent, the judgment of the learned Trial Court is not sustainable being passed contrary to the facts and law which according to them has rightly been reversed by the learned Chief Court vide its impugned judgment which is sustainable.

We have heard the learned Advocate General at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned judgment dated 19.05.2016 passed by the learned Chief Court as well as the judgment dated 30.08.2014 passed by the learned A nti- Terrorism Court at Gilgit. 

The perusal of the record reveals that the rrespondent has committed the murder of the deceased namely Ehsanullah beyond any shadow of doubts which has been proved by the prosecution through ocular evidence, circumstantial evidence, confessional statement of the accused, extra -judicial confession of accused, recovery of weapon of offence, fire arms, expert reports, chemical examiner’s report and death certificate etc. 

The said evidence has rightly been appreciated by the learned Trial Court through its judgment dated 30.08.2014 whereas the learned Chief Court fell in error by setting aside the judgment of the learned Trial Court through its impugned judgment. 

In our considered view, the said impugned judgment is the result of misreading/non - reading of the evidence and misinterpretation of the law, hence, the same is not tenable in law. 10. 

In view of the above discussions, we convert this petition into an appeal and the same is allowed. 

Consequently, the impugned judgment dated 19.05.2016 in Cr. 

Appeal No. 26/2014 passed by the learned Chief Court is set aside whereas the judgment dated 30.08.2014 in TC - No. 27 -28/2012 passed by the learned Anti -Terrorism Court at Gilgit is affirmed. 

The murder reference was answered in negative by the learned Chief Court is

The learned Trial Court is directed to execute its judgment/order dated 30.08.2014 in accordance with law. 11. 

The appeal is allowed in above terms.
