2 feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said impugned Judgment dated 28.11.2012, preferred this petition for leave to appeal before this Court with the pra yer that the said impugned judgment be set asi de. 

He further prayed that the establishment of Banking Court, the functioning and taking cognizance/jurisdiction of loan recovery cases by Banking Courts in Gilgit Baltistan are illegal, unlawful, without lawful authority and without jurisdiction. 

No noti fication regarding the establishment of Banking Courts through an Official Gazette by the Government of Gilgit Baltistan in terms of sub Section 1 & 2 of Section 5 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance 2001 read with Section 2 of t he Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Adaptation & Enforcement Order 2001 has been issued so far. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the taking cognizance & jurisdiction of Bank Recovery case of the petitioner and all other cases of the amo unts exceeding to 50 Million Rupees by the Honorable Judge Chief Court as Judge Banking Court is unlawful, illegal and without authority as the Honorable Judge of Banking Court has not been appointed by the Government of Gilgit Baltistan be ing the competent authority in term of Sub -Section 4 of Section 5 of the Financial Resources (Recovery of Finances) ordinance 2011 read with section 2 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Adap tation order 2001.

3 The learned counsel for the petitioner further contended that directions may be given to Respondent No.4 (Government of Gilgit Baltistan ) to exercise its powers vested in him vide Section 2 of the Financial Institutions (Recover of finances) Adaptation Order 2001 Read with Section 5 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance 2001 to establish Banking Courts in Gilgit Baltistan through proper Notification published in Official Gazette Government of Gilgit Baltistan, and there after appoint Banking Court Judges afte r a proper and meaningful consultation with the learned Chief Judge, Chief Court, Gilgit Baltistan. 

He continued his arguments while saying t hat the orders of the Chief Judg e, Chief Court, Gilgit Baltistan d ated 27.04. 2011 in Civil Suit No. 2 of 2010, nominating Hon’ ble (Justice Muzaffar Ali) to act as Banking Judge to take cognizance of all Bank Recovery cases in Gilgit Baltistan exceeding amount of 50 Million Rupee under the provisions of a repealed law of Banking Companies (Recovery of Loans, Advances, Credits and Finances) Act of 1997, is t otally illegal, unlawful and ab -initio void in the eyes of la w. 

The leaned counsel for the petitioner relied upon a reported case of Indian Supreme Court in case S.C Legal Aid Committee Versus Union of India, 1994 S CC (6) 731, JT 1994 (6) 544.

Which is lawful and in accordance of the law and Procedure, however, in the Notification dated 27.04.2011 while nominating Mr. 

Muzaffar Ali as Banking Judge Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan, the said law has erroneously been misquoted with provisions of a repealed law of Baking Companies (Recovery of Loans, Advances, Credits and Finances) Act 1997. 

He conte nded that misquoted of any law does not create any illegality and unlawfulness in any order. 

Hence, the order /Judgment dated 28.11.2012 in Writ Petition No. 85/2015, passed by the learned Division Bench of the Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan is requires to b e maintained being well reasoned and according to law. 

He also submits that the Banking Courts were established in accordance with law and their presiding Officers were also competently appointed as after promulgation of “the Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment and Self -Governance) Order, 2009” the powers vested to the Gilgit -Baltistan Council under Serial No. 05. 13, and 50 of Schedule -III of the said Order. 

He finally submitted that the counsel for the petitioner during his lengthy argument could not pointed ou t any illegality and infirmity in the impugned judgment dated 28.11.2012 in Writ Petition No. 85/2015, passed by the learned Division Bench of the Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan.
