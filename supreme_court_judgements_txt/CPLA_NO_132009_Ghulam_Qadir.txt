============================================================

2 challenging the order passed by the Motor Registration Authority Gilgit was allowed and the impugned order dated 23 -09-2008 was declared to be with out lawful authority and of no legal effect. 2. 

The facts forming the background of this leave to appeal are that the respondent No.1 had purchased a truck/troller be aring r egistration No.GLT -5613 model -1986 chases No.38309 and engine No -112057 from the present petitioner in consideration of Rs.1, 200,000/ - (Twelve Lac only). 3. 

Respondent No.1 had paid the entire amount to the petitioner and the petitioner got tr ansferred duplicate registration book in the name of respondent NO.1, but on 11 -9-2008, the petitioner with malafide intention submitted an application to the Motor Registration Authority Gilgit, for cancellation of duplicate Registration certificate wit h the pretext that the respondent No.1 fraudulently transferred the ownership of vehicle through duplicate registration book as such the duplicate registration Book may be cancelled. 4. 

On the said application the Motor Registration Authority had issued a final notice on 20 -9-2008, to the res pondent No.1 with the direction that respondent No.1 will appear before them within a week to settle the dispute once for all vide office order SEC/MRA(GLT) 1(9)/1195 -97/2008 dated 11 -09-2008 and 20 -09-2008. 

The said notice was received by the respondent No.1 on 26 -09-2008, and on the receipt of the said notice counsel for the petitioner (S.M. 

Mohsin Hamdani Advocate) informed the Motor Registration Authority Gilgit in writing that the respondent No.1 will a ppear after Eid -ul-Fitr on 10 -10-2008, but without giving opportunity to the respondent No. 1 and before expiry of stipulated period mentioned in final notice, the Motor Registration Authority Gilgit cancelled the duplicate registration certificate/owners hip of the respondent No.1 vide office order dated 23 -9-2008, which act of respondent No.2 is illegal, against fact, ex -parte, unheard and against the precious rights of the respondent No.1, as such the cancellation order dated 23-9-2008 is liable to be set aside. 5. 

We have heard Mr. 

Sharif Ahmed Advocate, the learned counsel for the petitioner and perused relevant record of the case, the learned counsel for the petitioner strenuously argued, that the impugned judgment of the Chief Court Gilgit - Baltistan is illegal, against the fact s, un-heard and against the norms of justice. 

Hence not maintainable. 

He further contended that initially the truck /troller cited above was sold in consideration of Rs.120, 0000/ - to the respondent No.1. 

Th e

3 ownership of the truck/troller also transferred and handed over its duplicate co py of registration book to respondent No.1, despite completion of codel formalities respondent No.1 with held 50,000/ - (fifty thousand only) without any reason, on account o f which petitioner have no option except to file representation for cancellation of duplicate registration book to respondent No.2. 

He further submitted that Motor Registration Authority (respondent No.2) has rightly cancelled the duplicate registration bo ok and restore the ownership of present petitioner. 

Counsel for petitioner further subm its that the Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan has utterly failed to follow the mandatory provisions of Order 5 Rule 20 and 21 of C.P.C. 

Hence great miscarriage of justice ha s been occasioned; therefore, the impugned judgment is not sustainable and liable to be set aside. 6. 

On the other hand the learned counsel for respondent No.1 Mr. 

Javed Iqbal, Advocate submits that the Hon’ble Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan has f ollowed all the mandatory provisions of law for summoning the present petitioner by adopting all the available means under Order 5 Rule 20 and 21 of C.P.C. 

In spite of notice, the present petitioner did not appear before the Chief Court, therefore the Hon’ ble Chief Court is absolutely right to pass judgment in favour of the respondent No.1. 

Learned counsel for respondent No.1 further submits that representative of respondent No.1 (Motor Registration Authority Gilgit) appeared before the Hon’ble Chief Court with relevant record. 

After perusal of record, it appears that the first owner /present petitioner appeared himself in the office of Motor Registration Authority Gilgit, with duplicate Registration alongwith sale deed, etc. for transfer of ownership in favour of respondent No.1. 

After going through the record the Hon’ble Chief Court has accepted the writ petition in favour of respondent No.1. 

The respondent No.1 has already paid all amount and nothing is due on respondent No.1, as such, he request that this leave to appeal is not maintainable and liable to be dismissed. 7. 

After giving careful consideration to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and p erusal of the record of the case, we have come to the conclusion th at the learned Division Bench of the Chief Court has followed all the mandatory provisions of law for attendance of the present petitioner by adopting all the available means under Order 5 Rule 20 and 21 of C.P.C. we have minutely gone into the impugned j udgment of the Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan, wherein the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan, has clearly referred the “order sheet” dated 26-3-2009, the contents of the order sheet and the relevant para of the impugned judgment of the Chief Court, which is reproduced herein below to appreciate the legal and fac tual aspects of the controversy: -

Despite of written request to respondent No.2, that respondent No.1 will a ppear before Motor Registration Authority Gilgit after “Edi-ul-Fitr” on 10-10-2008, but without giving opportunity to the respondent No.1 to meet the frivolous and con cocted allegations leveled by the present petitioner and before expiry of stipu lated period mentioned in the final notice, the respondent No.2 ( Motor Registration Authority Gilgit) has illegally cancelled the dupli cate copy of registration book, which act of respondent No.2 is ex -parte, unheard and against the precious ri ghts of the respondent No.1. 

The learned Division Bench of Chief Court Gilgit Baltistan has rightly set aside the order dated 23 -9-2008 passed by respondent No.2 (Motor Registration Authority Gilgit) As the result of above discus sion, we found no merit in this petition, the same is dismissed by upholding the judgment of Division Bench of Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan dated 22 -4-2009. 

Leave is refused. 

Petition di smissed Announced. 31-03-2010.
