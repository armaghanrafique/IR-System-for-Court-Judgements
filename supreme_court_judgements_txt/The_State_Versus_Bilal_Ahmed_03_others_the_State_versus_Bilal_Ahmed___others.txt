3 Court i.e. the learned Anti -Terrorism Court Gilgit who has rightly convicted the respondents/accused for their negligence in escaping the high profile Criminals from Cheetah Jail Jutial Gilgit. 

He also submits that the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court fell in error while passing the impugned judgment dated 10.12.2013 in Criminal Appeal No. 21/2013 which is not tenable being passed contrary to the law and facts of the case. 

He referred Section 6 (2)(i) of the Anti -Terrorism Act 1997. 

According to the learned Advocate General this case falls under the jurisdiction of the Anti -Terrorism Act. 4. 

On the other hand, Mr. 

Haji Peer Muhammad learned counsel for the respondents supports the impugned judgment dated 10.12.2013 in Criminal Appeal No. 21/2013 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court. 

He contends that the Chief Court has rightly set aside the judgmen t of the learned Anti -Terrorism Court which was not sustainable being passed without jurisdiction as the special law does not attract in this case. 

He prayed that the impugned judgment of the learned Chief Court may graciously be maintained. 5. 

We have h eard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned judgment dated 10.12.2013 in Criminal Appeal No. 21/2013 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court as well as the jud gment dated 26.08.2013 passed by the learned Anti -Terrorism Court No. 

II Gilgit -Baltistan. 

We have also

4 gone through the relevant provisions of the Anti -Terrorism Act 1997. 

We are in agreement with the findings of the learned Gilgit - Baltistan Chief Court as provisions of Section 6 & 7 of the Anti- Terrorism Act do not attracts & applicable in this case. 

The learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court has rightly held that the case is triable under the ordinary jurisdiction of the competent court of law i.e. the learned Sessions Court Gilgit. 

Furthermore, the learned Advocate General could not point out any illegality & infirmity in the impugned judgment which in our considered view is well reasoned and well founded. 6. 

In view of the above discussions, we dismis s this appeal. 

Consequently, the impugned judgment dated 10.12.2013 in Criminal Appeal No. 21/2013 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court is affirmed. 

The learned Sessions Court Gilgit is required to hear and dispose the case in its own merits without being influe nced by the observations, if any, of this court or by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court. 7. 

The appeal is dismissed in above terms.
