Please refer to your letter No.CC -E-4/2010 dated 12the June, 2010 on the subject noted above. 

The requisite report is as under: - 2. 

Prior to 8th July, 2003, there were five declared Sessions Divisions i.e Gilgit, Skardu, Diamer, Ghizer and Ghanche, in Gilgit -Baltistan. 

At that time, the posts of District and sessions Judges were up -graded and placed in BS -20. 

Due to retirement of three District and Sessions Judges, the vacant posts of the incumbents were required to be filled 100% by promotion under the prevailing Recruitment and Promotion Rules. 

At that time the posts of Civil Judges were in BS -17 and were not eligible for promotion to the vacant post of three District and Session Judges BS -20 for want of qualifying service coupled with non -existence of the feeding posts of additional District & sessions Judges BS-19 for promotion to the vacant posts of District and sessions Judges BS -20. 3. 

The then Chairman Chief Court NAs (Mr. 

Justice Muzaffar H.Malik) had proposed to downgrade the post of District and Sessions Judge Ghizer, Ghanch, and Diamer instead of seeking condonation of defic iency in qualifying service in favour of the three Civil Judges from the then Chief Executive NAs (Federal Minister KA & NA division) under Rule 5 serial No.8 Schedule III of the Northern Areas Rules of Business, 1994. 

The proposal of Chairman Chief Court for downgrading of three Sessions divisions was approved by KA&NA Islamabad on 08 -07-2003 and three Civil Judges were promoted to the downgraded post of additional District &Sessions Judges BS -19. 

The GB administration has never recommended for downgradati on of any Sessions division. 

It is also pertinent to mention here that the three Additional Sessions Judges i.e Ghizer, Ghanche, and Astore, have been taking cognizance of criminal case in violation of procedural law of Cr.P.C.” • Mr. 

Hafiz -ur-Rehman Secreta ry, Law and Prosecution Department, Government of Gilgit -Baltistan stated that the Government of Gilgit -Baltistan has never recommended down gradation of Sessions Divisions and the charge of Session Divisions with Additional District and Sessions Judges in districts Ghizar, Ghanchay and Astore is in violation of law. 

The Registrar, Chief Court also taking similar view of the matter added that the Sessions Divisions in question were down -graded for the purpose of promotion of Judicial Officers in the subordi nate Judiciary and
