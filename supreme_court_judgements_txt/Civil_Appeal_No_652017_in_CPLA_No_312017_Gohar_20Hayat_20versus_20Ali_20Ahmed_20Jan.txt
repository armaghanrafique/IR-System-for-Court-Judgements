Respondent No. 07 and other person namely Fazal challenged the above decree before the District Judge Gilgit thereafter the s ame was withdrawn during the course of which the above Fazal has gone to his account and his Legal heirs qua the present petitioner No.01 filed a revision petition before the learned Chief Court Section alongwith the above defendant Jan Alam which was dis missed as withdrawn vide order dated 13.09.2013 passed in Civil Revision No. 20/2012 and in this was the judgment /decree dated 08.10.2010 attained finality.

The same was further assailed through Revision Petition before the learned District Judge. 

The learned First Appellate court vide judgment /order dismissed the revision Petition hold ing the same devoid of any merit which was subsequently upheld by the learned Chief Court. 3. 

The learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the judgment/decree dated 08.10.2010 in Civil Suit No. 08/2009 was obtained by the respondents through fraud, misrepresentation and want of jurisdiction without impleading the petitioners as necessary party. 

He also submits that the grandfather of the petitioners and judgment debtor i.e. late Mirza Baig and the grandfather of the decree holders/respondents No. 01 & 02 were real brothers inter se. 

Mirza Baig died leaving behind three (03) sons i.e. 

Maj. 

Nadir Aman, Muhammad Baig and Shamsher (Minors) and two (02) daughters namely Mst. 

Shukrat and Nijat. 

Nadir Aman died leaving behind three (03) sons namely Me hboob Alam, Jan Alam and Ghulam Murtaza similarly Jan Alam died leaving behind two (02) sons i.e. 

Zahid Karim and Shahid Karim. 

Likewise, Muhammad Baig died leaving behind two (02) sons and one (01) daughter namely the petitioner and judgment debtor respon dent No. 07. 

He further submits that Shamsher died leaving behind 04 sons Manzoor Karim, Ghazi Karim, Sartaj Karim and Sarfraz Karim.

Similarly, Qalamo, the grandfather of the decree holders/respondents No. 01 and 02 died leaving behind 03 sons namely Muhammad Shafa, Akbar and Muham mad (Minors). 

Muhammad Shafa died leaving behind the decree holder and 01 daughter Mst. 

Shamia whereas Akbar died issueless while Muhammad Issa died leaving behind 02 sons and 01 daughter i.e. 

Danish, Suleiman and Nazia. 

Per learned counsel, the petitioner s and the respondents have common landed property at Danyore Gilgit and at Ali Abad Hunza. 

After the deaths of both the grandfathers of the respective parties, the partition of the common property took place amongst the eldest sons of Mirza Baig and Muhamm ad Shafa. 

According to the said partition, the landed property at Danyore Gilgit went into the share of Muhammad Shafa and his brother while landed at Aliabad Hunza went into the share of Nadir Aman and his brothers. 

The legal heirs of the respective parties are in the possession of the respective properties. 

He reiterates that although there are concurrent findings of the three courts below against the petitioners yet the said findings were based on misrepresentatio n, fraud and want of jurisdiction and the same may graciously be set aside being not sustainable. 4. 

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondents supports the impugned judgment as well as the concurrent findings of the learned courts below. 

He contends that filing of the suit and the proceedings thereto in various courts of law was in the knowledge of the petitioners. 

Further, the petitioners

5 also contested the suit by joining the proceedings, hence, the plea of fraud and misrepresentation taken by the petitioners is not understandable. 

Per learned counsel, the house in question was handed over to the plaintiffs in the year 1998 by the elders of Qabila-e-Khurkose by partitioning the joint property of the respective parties and the responden ts are in the possession of the said land/house since then. 

He contends that the possession of the property in question has been admitted by the petitioners / defendants in Para -2 and 03 in their written statement s. 

Per learned counsel, all the three courts below have rightly dismissed the application under Section 12(2) CPC filed by the petitioners being not maintainable. 

He prays that the impugned judgment dated 06.12.2016 passed by the learned Chief Court may graciously be affirmed. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned judgment as well as orders/judgments of courts below. 

The learned counsel for the petitioners has not controverted that the proceedings on record of Civil Suit and the Revision, was in the knowledge of the petitioners rather they participated in the said proceedings. 

In our considered view, the impugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court is well reasoned as no infirmity and illegality is pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioners, hence, no interference is warranted into the impugned judgment.
