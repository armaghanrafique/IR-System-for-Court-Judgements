The petitioner being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the Judgment of the learned trial Court filed Criminal Appeal No. 20/2014 in the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court. 

Upon hearing the learned Chief Court reversed the Judgment of the learned Trial Court by remandi ng back the case to the learned trial Court for denovo trial under Section 302 PP vide Impugned Order dated 28.04.2016 in the light of evidence available on file, treating the prosecution evidence already recorded in proof of guilt of accused for the charg e of Section 302 PPC. 4. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that basically this case falls under Section 316 PPC as the charge of committing alleged murder of the deceased was not intentional and deliberate rather it caused all of sudden due to clash of the accused with the deceased for watering the Cricket ground by the accused and for forbidding by the deceased. 

He submits that initially the petitioner was charged under section 302 which was controverted by the petitioner through an applica tion which was accepted by the learned Trial Court on 11.12.2013. 

Per learned counsel the respondent challenged the order dated 11.12.2013 of the learned trial Court in the learned Chief Court by filing Civil Revision which was dismissed in default on 12.0 9.2014 which was not assailed by the complainant at any appropriate Forum. 

He submits that later on the learned Chief Court while hearing the Criminal Appeal set aside the said order of its own Court by exercising the Supervisory Jurisdiction which is not sustainable as no application was filed for

============================================================

5 setting aside the same by the complainant. 

He adds that case of the complaint revolves upon the statement of the FIR lodger who is admittedly not an eye -witness of the case and the case is based on the hearsay ev idence which has no value in the eyes of law. 

Moreover, his statement before the Court is altogether different from his written application which was submitted by him in the Police Station for lodging FIR. 

He submits that the Prosecution has miserably fail ed to prove the allegations against the petitioner /accused beyond any shadow of doubts as the Statements of the so called eye -witnesses are contradictory with each other’s which shatter the story of the prosecution. 

He maintains that the alleged recover y of the cricket bat has been affected from the accused after an inordinate delay of 06 days and there is no explanation with regard to the delay by the Prosecution which also makes the case doubtful. 

He prays that the Judgment dated 04.07.2014 passed in Session Case No. 17/2017 by the learned trial Court and the Impugned order dated 28.04.2016 in Criminal Appeal No. 20/2014 passed by the learned Chief Court may kindly be set aside as the same are not sustainable being passed contrary to the law and facts of the case. 5. 

Conversely, the learned Advocate General contends that it is a day light occurrence whereby the accused has been charged directly by the independent eye witnesses who attributed specific role to the accused in commission of the alleged offence. 

He also contends that the crime article used in committing of offence i.e. the

6 (Cricket bat) has also been recovered on the pointation of petitioner which is admissible in evidence. 

He further contends that there are other corroborative evidence w hich connect s the petitioner with the commission of the crime. 

Per learned Advocate General a rift was initially arose between the deceased and the accused on the issue of watering the cricket ground by the accused but the same was resolved by the interven tion of PW-02 Shahid Hussain, PW Azfar and PW Aitzaz who were present at the scene of crime. 

He adds that after settlement of the dispute/ quarrel by the said PWs, the petitioner intentionally and deliberately hit the deceased with a bat due to which he die d. 

Per learned Advocate General i t is an intentional murder (Qatl -e-Amd) not the murder by mistake (Qatl -e-Khata). 

He reiterates that the learned Trial Court has wrongly and illegally altered the charge of Section 302 PPC into Section 316 PPC which was rig htly reversed by the learned Chief Court vide impugned order dated 28.04.2016. 

The learned Advocate General contends that the statement of PWs corroborates with each other. 

The recovery of alleged crime article was made on the pointation of the petitioner which is admissible in evidence. 

Likewise the medical evidence also corroborates the ocular account. 

He prays that in view of the above material on record, the Impugned order dated 28.04.2016 in Criminal Appeal No. 20/2014 passed by the learned Chief Court, may graciously not be interfere d with. 6. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone

7 through the Impugned order dated 28.04.2016 in Criminal Appeal No. 20/2014 passed by the le arned Chief Court as well as the Judgment dated 04.07.2014 passed in Session Case No. 17/2017 by the learned Trial Court. 

The careful perusal of the case file and material on record, prima facie the alleged offence falls under Section 302 PPC as rightly held by the learned Chief Court. 

Further the learned counsel for the petitioner could also not point out any illegality, irregularity and infirmity in the impugned order dated 28.04.2016 passed by the learned Chief Court. 7. 

In view of the above discussio ns, we dismiss this appeal. 

Consequently, the Impugned order dated 28.04.2016 in Criminal Appeal No. 20/2014 passed by the learned Chief Court is maintained. 8. 

The appeal is dismissed in above terms.
