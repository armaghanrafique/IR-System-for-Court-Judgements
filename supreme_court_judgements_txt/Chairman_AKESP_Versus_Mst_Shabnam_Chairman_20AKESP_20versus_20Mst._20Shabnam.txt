2 consideration as such we noticed to the respondent to meet the same. 

We after hearing, both the counsel for the parties reached to the conclusion that the petition cannot be converted into appeal as the same is meritless for the r easons here after to be recorded. 

The brief facts wrapped with this petition are as such that the present petitioners holding administration of a private group of education in Gilgit -Baltistan.

3 learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan and a learned Single Judge of the Chief court passed the impugne d order dated 06 -12-2013 and maintained the judgment passed by the learned District Judge Ghizer. 

Hence this petition before this court against the impugned judgment passed by the learned Single Judge of the Chief Court Gilgit - Baltistan. 

The learned couns el for the petitioner urges that the present respondent lacks teaching abilities, but record otherwise shows that, she passed her F.A. examination and also succeeded to pass her C.T. examination during her service as a Teacher in the said institution. 

She has gone through various trainings and workshops under the education system running by the present petitioners as such she was placed in top -C by the administration. 

The learned counsel for the petitioners assails the maintainability of the suit and also jurisdiction of the civil courts with the contention that since the petitioners are a company / corporation under the company ordinance 1994 and has its own rules as such “ Principle of Master and Servant ” applies to the instant case and the civil courts la ck jurisdiction to entertain any suit against the petitioner by their servants. 

We are in consonance with the findings of the learned Single Bench of the Chief court and disagree with the learned counsel regarding the jurisdiction. 

The respondents are run ning an

4 educational institution in Gilgit -Baltistan and teachers appointed by them in various institutions could not be let at the mercy of the petitioners on pretext of Principle of “Master and Servant ” because as per legal maxim “ubi jus ibi remedium, where there is a right. 

There is a remedy. 

It is further to say that, the respondents came within the definition of “legal person ” and they can be sued against. 

Last but not the least, the present respondent has spent 13 precious years of her life in the said institution and all of a sudden, after expiry of her age to get any service in any other institution /department, the petitioners under principle of equity might not be allowed to kick the poor lady out from her respective service on the pretext of p rinciple of “Master and servant ”. 

The respondents to mind it that, the age of slavery has gone and the “Principle of Master and Servant ” does not mean the “principle of slavery ”. 

Hence the petition is refused to grant and the impugned order is upheld.
