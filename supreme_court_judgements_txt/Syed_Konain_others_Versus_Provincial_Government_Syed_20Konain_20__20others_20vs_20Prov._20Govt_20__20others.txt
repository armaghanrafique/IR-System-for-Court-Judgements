2 on the grounds that the posts of the incumbents have not been included in the NIS. 

The petitioners being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with filed Writ Petition No. 139/2014 in the learned Chief Court praying therein that the respondents be directed to include the posts of the petitioners in the NIS of the Finance Department Gilgit -Baltistan by declaring the petitioners to be entitled to appear before the committee constituted by the then Chief Minister Gilgit -Baltistan in order to prove their qualification as done with other 461 teachers of Education, Department Gilgit - Baltistan. 

Upon hearing, the learned Chief Court dismissed the said Writ Petition. 3. 

The learned counsel for the petition ers submits that three (03) committee were constituted by the respondents in order to check the suitability and the qualification of the teachers who were appointed alongwith the petitioners. 

He submits that the petitioners have not been given opportunity to be presented before such committee as such the petitioners have been discriminated and not treated equally amongst equals. 

Per learned counsel, the petitioners were appointed by the competent authorities and they were performing their duties to the enti re satisfaction to their seniors but their services have been terminated illegally and without giving any reasons. 

He further submits that the petitioners were constrained to file Writ Petition in the learned Chief Court which upon hearing has wrongly been dismissed vide impugned order. 

Per learned counsel, the said impugned judgment is not

3 sustainable and liable to be set aside by allowing this petition for leave to appeal. 4. 

On the other hand, the learned Advocate General supports the impugned order pas sed by the learned Chief Court. he contends that the facts of the case are different from the case of those 461 teachers who have been called for verification of their qualification by the various departmental committees. 

Per learned Advocate General, sinc e, the petitioners have been appointed illegally and unlawfully by the unauthorized authorities without fulfilling the codal formalities of the service rules, therefore, they are no more employees of Education Department. 

He further contends that the learned Chief Court has rightly dismissed the Writ Petition of the petitioners as the same was not maintainable. 

He prays that the impugned order may graciously be maintained. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, per used the material on record and gone through the impugned order. 

Admittedly, the petitioners were appointed illegally, unlawfully and without fulfilling the requisite codal formalities by the respondents, therefore, they can not be considered as the employ ees of Education Department. 

In our considered view, the impugned order is well founded as no infirmity has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioners. 6. 

In view of the above discussions, we convert this petition into an appeal and the same is dismissed. 

Consequently, the
