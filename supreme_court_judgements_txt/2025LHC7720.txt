No. 1850 / 2025 The Decree Holder Bank filed instant Application under Section 19(3) of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 (the “ Ordinance ”) read with Rules 3 & 4 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Rules, 2018 (the “ Recovery Rules ”) seeking permission of the Court for conducting public auction of the mortgaged properties without intervention of this Court. 2. 

Learned counsel for the Decree Holder Bank submits that Section 19(3) of the Ordinance read with Rules 3 & 4 of the Recovery Rules permit the Decree Holder Bank to sell the charged properties through public auction without recourse to the Banking Court in accordance with the prescribed proced ure to execute the Decree already passed in favo ur of the Decree Holder on 18.03.2025. 

No specific permission of the Court is required in this behalf, however, since Fard Taliqa was submitted before this Court and notices were issued to the Judgment Debtor s under Order XXI, Rule 66 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the “ CPC ”), therefore, for the sake of propriety, the instant Application has been filed to seek permission of

2 Execution Application No. 01 / 2025 this Court to conduct public auction without intervention of this Court in accor dance with the provisions of Section 19 of the Ordinance and the Recovery Rules which may be granted, accordingly. 3. 

Learned counsel for the Judgment Debtors contends that the Decree Holder Bank has filed the titled Execution Application in terms of Orde r XXI, Rule 11 of the CPC and acting upon the same, this Court issued notice under Order XXI, Rule 17 of the CPC to the Judgment Debtors, appointed Court Auctioneers in terms of Order XXI, Rule 65 of the CPC, fixed their tentative fee and expenses with a direction to evaluate the mortgaged properties through appointed evaluator approved by Pakistan Banks Association. 

As such, the Decree Holder Bank has exercised its option under Section 19(2) of the Ordinance to execute the Decree in accordance with the pro visions of the CPC. 

Therefore, after initiation of auction proceedings in terms of Order XXI of the CPC, the Decree Holder cannot switch or depart from the opted mode of execution to another as provided in the Ordinance. 

Hence, the instant Application unde r Section 19(3) of the Ordinance is not maintainable. 

Reliance is placed on cases titled, “Muhammad Attique v. 

Jami Limited and others ” (2015 SCMR 148 ); “Lanvin Traders, Karachi v. 

Presiding Officer, Banking Court No. 2, Karachi and others ” (2013 SCMR 1419 ); and “ Muhammad Hussain v. 

Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan, Hyderabad and another ” (2014 MLD 192 ). 4. 

At the outset, it is noted that the referred case law has been perused. 

In the cases of Muhammad Attique and Lanvin Traders (supra), the validity of public auctions conducted by Court Auctioneers under supervision of the Court according to the provisions of the CPC were scrutinized. 

In this context, a passing observation was made to the effect that once the Court opts to execu te a decree in accordance with the provisions of the CPC, it cannot depart from the applicable procedure. 

In all fairness, the observation

============================================================
PAGE 3
============================================================

3 Execution Application No. 01 / 2025 in the peculiar factual context simply implies that where a public auction is carried out pursuant to the provisions of the CPC, it would be judicially examined in terms of the requirements of applicable provisions of the CPC. 

Similarly, in Muhammad Hussain case (supra), the Court also examined the validity of a public auction conducted under its supervision and in this behalf, observed as under: - “48. ….In the case in hand, however, it is not disputed that the mode of execution as provided under C.P.C. was adopted. 

This fact is evident from proceedings taken place in the execution. 

The word or used twice in subsection (2 ) of section 19 of F.I.O. 2001 [Ordinance No. 

XLVI of 2001] has to be read disjunctively, which classify three modes for execution of the decree. 

In our view however, once the mode for executing of the decree is chosen then the same cannot be switched over to another mode by the executing court much less unilaterally. ” 5. 

In the above case, the Court also did not hold that once the process of public auction has been initiated by the Banking Court under the provisions of the CPC, it is precluded forever to g rant permission to the Decree Holder to exercise other options ordained in law to sell the charged properties on its own without intervention of the Court. 

Rather, it is emphasized that if a public auction is conducted under the supervision of the Court, t he same has to proceed in accordance with the provisions of the CPC. 

The validity of such a public auction shall be judicially scrutinized on the touchstone of applicable provisions of the CPC and non -compliance thereof cannot be condoned for the reason th at the Banking Court is empowered by Section 19(2) of the Ordinance to adopt other modes of execution. 

As such, in none of the above cases, it has been held that once an option to sell a charged property by way of public auction through the Court in accord ance with the provisions of the CPC has been exercised, it creates a permanent clog on the right of the Decree Holder to seek and the power of the Court to grant permission to sell a charged property without the intervention of the Court t hrough a consciou s order of the Court.

Therefore, it emerges from the rival contentions of the parties that the precise question requiring determination is as to whether the Banking Court is precluded to grant permission to the Decree Holder to sell the charged propert y by itself through public auction or sealed tenders after it has commenced execution proceedings in accordance with the provisions of the CPC under Section 19 of the Ordinance? 7. 

Record reflects that suit for recovery was decreed on 18.03.2025. 

The Judgment stipulated that in the event of non -payment of decretal amount within 30 days from the date of the Judgment, the Decree shall automatically stand converted into execution procee dings as ordained in Section 19(1) of the Ordinance and shall be listed for hearing on a date to be fixed by office. 

Later, the Decree Holder Bank filed the titled Execution Application accompanied with Fard Taliqa informing non -payment of decretal amount and praying to proceed in the execution proceedings. 

The Application was fixed for hearing on 30.04.2025 when notices were issued to the Judgment Debtors, Court Auctioneers were appointed, their tentative fee and expenses were fixed and they were directed to propose terms and conditions of sale in terms of Order XXI, Rule 66 of the CPC for public auction after evaluating the mortgaged properties listed in Fard Taliqa from the appointed evaluator. 

No meaningful step was taken in furtherance of the referred o rder when the Decree Holder filed the instant Application. 8. 

The Ordinance is a special law entailing specific procedure for the ‘financial institutions’ and the ‘customers’ to resolve inter se disputes with reference to ‘finance’ in terms of their mutu al rights and obligations through the Banking Court. 

Section 7(1) of the Ordinance vests all powers of Civil Court in the Banking Court. 

Section 7(2) thereof proclaims that the Banking Court shall follow the procedure laid down in the CPC in all matters re garding which special procedure has not been provided for in the Ordinance. 

Similarly, Section 7(4) of

(7) Where the mortgagor or his agent or servant or any person put in possession by the mortgagor or on account of the mortgagor does not voluntarily give possessio n of the mortgaged property sought to be sold or sought to be purchased or purchased by the financial institution, a Banking Court on application of the financial institution or purchaser shall put the financial institution or purchaser, as the case may be, in possession of the mortgaged property in any manner deemed fit by it: Provided that the Banking Court may not order eviction of a person who is in occupation of the mortgaged property or any part thereof under a bona fide lease, except on expiry of th e period of the lease, or on payment of such compensation as may be agreed between the parties or as may be determined by the Banking Court to be reasonable.

(Emphasis Supplied ) 10. 

In addition to the above statutory stipulations, the Federal Government in exercise of powers conferred under Section 15(5) of

============================================================
PAGE 9
============================================================

9 Execution Application No. 01 / 2025 the Ordinance has promulgated the Recovery Rules under Section 25 of the Ordinance envisaging a detailed procedure to be followed by a financial institution in case of sale by itself through public auction without intervention of the Court providing protection to the rights and interests of the Judgment Debtors and other stake holders to ensure transparency and fairness. 11. 

The analysis of above provisions of law makes it abundantly clear that the Ordinance has endeavored to provide for multiple options regarding execution of a banking Decree so that the same is satisfied within a reasonable time. 

Section 19 of the Ordinance is a complete code for execution of a banking Decree and grants certain definite and substantive rights to a financial institution, subject to the conditions prescribed under Section 19 read with relevant and applicable provisions of Section 15 of the Ordinanc e. 

Section 19(1) of the Ordinance provides for automatic conversion of suit into execution proceedings without the need to file a separate application and issue fresh notice to the Judgment Debtors. 

However, it importantly provides that process of executio n of a banking Decree shall commence at the Banking Court upon automatic conversion of Decree into execution proceedings where the Decree Holder is obliged to submit particulars of the mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated property and other assets of the Jud gment Debtor for consideration of the Banking Court and the case is heard by the Banking Court. 

Section 19(2) of the Ordinance provides three explicit modes to the Banking Court to execute a banking Decree (a) in accordance with the provisions of the CPC; or (b) in accordance with any other law for the time being in force; or (c) in such manner as the Banking Court may at the request of the Decree Holder consider appropriate, including recovery as arrears of land revenue. 

Section 19(3) of the Ordinance confers a special privilege to a financial institution with respect to mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated property which is not available to a financial institution regarding other personal properties of the

============================================================

============================================================

10 Execution Application No. 01 / 2025 Judgment Debtor. 

As such, a financial institution ca n sell or cause to be sold, the charged properties of the Judgment Debtor subject of Decree either with or without the intervention of the Banking Court either by public auction or by inviting sealed tenders and appropriate the proceeds towards total or pa rtial satisfaction of the Decree. 

This privilege has been subjected to the discretion of the Court, to be exercised according to the facts of each case. 

The Decree constitutes and confers sufficient power and authority to a financial institution qua sale o f charged assets and a financial institution can transfer marketable title subject to the remedies extended in terms of relevant and applicable provisions of Section s 15 & 19 of the Ordinance. 

As such, Section 19(3) of the Ordinance encapsulates a specific covenant in addition to three modes of execution available to the Banking Court under Section 19(2) of the Ordinance. 

The request of the Decree Holder in terms of Section 19(3) of the Ordinance, however, is required to be considered under the third mode o f execution catered for in Section 19(2) of the Ordinance. 

The other provisions of Section 19 read with applicable provisions of Section 15 of the Ordinance and the Recovery Rules regarding execution prescribe a detailed mechanism to be complied with in ca se of sale of charged property through sealed tenders or public auction with or without intervention of the Court. 

However, the overall scheme of law regarding execution of a banking Decree importantly recognize the overarching powers and role of the Banki ng Court throughout the execution proceedings including the power to examine accounts and settle all disputes relating to the sale of the mortgaged property. 12. 

It, therefore, follows that power has been extended to the Banking Court to grant permission to the Decree Holder at any stage of execution proceedings to exercise the option to sell charged property by way of mortgage, pledge or hypothecation without intervention of the Court either by sealed tenders or publi c auction subject to conditions and a conscious order passed in this respect

============================================================
PAGE 11
============================================================

11 Execution Application No. 01 / 2025 under Section 19(1) read with Section 19(3) of the Ordinance. 

Any other interpretation would defeat the express intention of the legislature and would attach redundancy to the sch eme of execution enshrined under the Ordinance. 

Therefore, th e discretion vested with the Banking Court to adopt an appropriate mode of execution at the request of the Decree Holder in terms of Section 19(2) of the Ordinance cannot be curtailed and such di scretion has been regulated by the law. 

However, once a Banking Court has adopted any permissible mode of execution under Section 19(2) of the Ordinance, a conscious order is required to annul the proceedings being conducted under any specific mode of exec ution and resort to another based upon the facts and circumstances of the case. 

Nevertheless, if the Banking Court intends to sell a property through public auction under its supervision in accordance with the provisions of the CPC, then the procedure list ed in the CPC shall be followed. 

Similarly, if the Banking Court intends to sell a property in accordance with any other law for the time being in force, the procedure envisaged therein shall be followed. 

Hence, the Banking Court at any stage of execution proceedings can consider the request of the Decree Holder to execute a banking Decree in such manner as it may consider appropriate through conscious application of mind. 

For reference, see case titled, “Shahida Bibi and others v. 

Habib Bank Limited and ot hers” (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 995 ). 13. 

In the instant case, the Decree Holder Bank has procured the banking Decree. 

Mortgaged, pledged and hypothecated properties subject of Decree dated 18.03.2025 are listed in Fard Taliqa. 

No meaningful steps in terms of Order dated 30.04.2025 have taken place beyond issuance of notice under Order XXI, Rule 66 of the CPC and passing of ancillary directions which were not complied with till the filing of Application under consideration. 

The sale of charged properties by the Decree Holder Bank through public auction without intervention of the Court is likely to complete at a faster time track

Section 19(3) of the Ordinance allows the Decree Holder Bank to sell charged properties through public auction and there is no impediment to withhold or deny such permission. 14. 

In view of the above, the instant Application is allowed; the Order dated 30.04.2025 to the extent of appointment, fee and expenses of Court Auctioneers along with ancillary directions to them qua filing of proposed terms and conditions of sale and evaluation of properties through appointed evaluator is hereby recalled; and the Decree Holder Bank is permitted to sell the charged properties listed in Fard Taliqa through public auction without intervention of the Court in accordance with the requirements of Section 19 of the Ordinance read with the Recovery Rules.
