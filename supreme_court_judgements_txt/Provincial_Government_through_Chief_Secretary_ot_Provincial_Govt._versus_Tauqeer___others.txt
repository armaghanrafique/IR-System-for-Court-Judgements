This petition has been directed against the impugned judgment dated 11.12.2014 in Suo Moto Case No. 09/2013 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court, whereby the application of the respondents was

============================================================

============================================================

2 accepted an d the petitioners No. 01 to 05 were directed to appoint the respondents against the posts they were appoin ted since 01.04.2013. 

The respondents were declared fully entitled for back service benefits thereto. 

The petitioners feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with filed petition for leave to appeal. 

The leave was granted on 20.05.2015 and the operation of th e impugned judgment was also suspended. 

The case was finally fixed for hearing today i.e. 02.08.2016. 2. 

Briefly the facts of the case are that the respondent No. 01 was initially appointed as Forest Guard on 01.11.2007 temporarily on a fix pay under a development project titled “Capacity Building of Forest Department Northern Areas”. 

On the expiry of the period of the said project, the respondent No. 01 again re-appointed as Forest Guard on 01.03.2012 purely on temporary basis with a fix ed pay under an another project i.e. “Forest Resource in Gilgit -Baltistan”. 

Later on the respondent No. 01 was appointed as Chowkidar under contingent head on 01.01.2008 whereas the respondent No. 03 was appointed as contingent paid Chowkidar on 14. 12.2010 and th ey are performing their duties as Chowkid ars on contingent basis till date. 

The record of the case transpires that afterward some other posts had been sanctioned in the office of the Conservator of Forest, Gilgit -Baltistan against which individuals amongst the Forest Department Gilgit -Baltistan were appointed /adjusted. 

The respondents feeling aggrieved filed application before the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court which

============================================================

============================================================

3 was treated as a Suo Moto case and upon hearing it was allowed vide judgment dated 11.12.2014 by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court. 3. 

The learned Advocate General submits that the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 71 of “The Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009” was not supposed to enter into the realm of factual controversy and give any opinion/verdict thereto. 

He also submits that the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court has no jurisdiction to take the Suo Moto notice as it is only the domain of Supreme Ap pellate Court Gilgit -Baltistan under Article 61 of the Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009 read with Article 184 (3) of the Constitution 1973 Islamic Republic of Pakistan. 

He also submits that under no circumstances the learned Ch ief Court Gilgit -Baltistan could meddle with the affairs in which an adequate and efficacious remedy can be had from the Court s below. 

He also submits that “Article 71 of The Gilgit - Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009”, does not provide t o the Chief Court to exercise of Suo Moto jurisdiction and an order passed in exercise of such jurisdiction shall be corrum - non-judice. 

He finally submits that the impugned judgment dated 11.12.2014 in Suo Moto Case 09/2013 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court is illegal, void ab -initio and without jurisdiction, hence, the same is not sustainable. 

While saying so he relied upon the case laws of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan

============================================================

============================================================

4 reported as PLD 1960 SC 295, 2 000 SCMR 1046, 1982 SCMR 549 and 2014 SCMR 122. 

He also cited the judgment of this court in Petition No. 86/2014 titled The Secretary Works Gilgit -Baltistan & 03 others versus Talib Shah & others. 4. 

On the other hand, Mr. 

Amjad Hussain the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents supports the impugned Judgment and argued that the learned Chief Court on getting information about infringement of any fundamental right was well within its rights to step in and pass an appropria te order. 

He contends that where fundamentals rights of the citizens are trampled over, the Chief Court can exercise of its Suo Moto Jurisdiction. 

He finally submits that the learned Chief Court, Gilgit - Baltistan has rightly taken cognizance of the matter and passed an appropriate order redressing the grie vances of the persons aggrieved as held in a case of similar nature by learned High Court of Baluchistan reported as PLD 2013 Quetta 75. 5. 

We have heard the learned Counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned Judgment dated 11.12.2014 in Suo Moto Case No. 09/2013 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court. 

The case law cited by the learned counsel for the respondent is distingu ishable whereas the case laws relied by the learned Advocate General are applicable. 6. 

The question arises as to whether Article 71 of The Gilgit - Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009 read with

============================================================
PAGE 5
============================================================

5 Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, expressly or by implication, provides for exercise of Suo Moto Jurisdiction by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan or otherwise. 7. 

For convenience we hereby reproduced both the articles i.e. 

Artic le 71 of “The Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009”, and “Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973” as under: - Under Article 71: - Jurisdiction of Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan:- (1) The Chief Court shall have such jurisdiction as is conferred on it by this Order or by any other law. 2.

Where: - (a). an application is made to the Chief Court for an order under sub clause (a) or sub -clause (c) of clause (2); and (b). 

The court has reason to believe that the making of an interim order would have the effect of prejudicing or interfering with the carrying out of public work or otherwise being harmful to the public interes t, the Court shall not make an interim order unless the Advocate General has been given notice of the application and the Court, after the Advocate General or any officer authorized by him in this behalf has been given an opportunity of being heard, is satisfied that the making of the interim order would not have the effect referred to in sub - clause (b) of this clause. 4. in this article unless the context otherwise requires, the expression “person” includes anybody politic or Corporate, any authority of or under control of the Council or the Government and any Court or Tribunal other than the Gilgit - Baltistan Supreme Appellate Court, the Chief Court or a Court or Tribunal Established under a law relating to the Armed Forced of Pakis tan.

============================================================

8 the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, is satisfied that the interim order --- (i) Would not have such effect as aforesaid; or (ii) Would have the effect of suspending an order or proceeding which on the face of the record is without jurisdiction. (4A) An interim order made by a High Court on an application made to it to question the validity or legal effe4ct of any order made, proceeding taken or act done by any authority or person, which has been made, taken or done or purports to have been made, taken or done under any law which is specified in part 1 of the First Schedule or relates to, or is connected with, State property or assessment or collection of public revenues shall cease to have effect on the expiration of a period of six months following the day on which it is made: Provided that the matter shall be finally decided by the High Court within six months from the date on which the interim order is made.

A careful perusal of both the articles reproduced above would show that the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan & High

============================================================
PAGE 9
============================================================

9 Courts of Pakistan would exercise its extraordinary discretionary constitutional Jurisdiction where it is satisfied that, subject to the constitution, no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of a person whether aggrieved or not on an information or on its own knowledge. 9. 

In support of the above discussions we have also been fortified by the judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, although, the judgment s of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan are not binding on this court yet it have persuasive affect. 

In a case Fazl -e-Haq, Accountant General, West Pakistan versus The State (supra ) the larger bench of the Apex Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold that the High Court s of Pakistan are not empowered to initiate suo moto proceedings. 

In case any Writ so issued by the High Court, the proceedings in Writ Petition were quashed, i n the case of Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif & other versus Muhammad Habib Wahab Alkhairi & others (supra ) the larger bench of the learned Apex Court of Pakistan did not interfere with the judgment passed by the Division Bench of Lahore High Court Lahore in an intra-Court appeal. 

The learned Division Bench of Lahore High Court Lahore in intra -Court appeal has held that the suo moto jurisdiction exercised by the learned single Judge under Article 199 of the Constitution was without jurisdiction. 

Consequently, the entire proceedings were quashed, i n the case of Akhter Abbas & others versus Nayyar Hussain (supra ) the Apex Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold that the High Court cannot

============================================================
PAGE 10
============================================================

10 issue a Writ under suo moto jurisdiction, i n the case of Dr. 

Imran Khattak and others versus Ms. 

Sofia Waqas Khattak & others (supra ) the Apex Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold t hat the High Courts of Pakistan are not empowered to exercise suo moto jurisdiction. 

We have also earlier followed the aforementioned parameters laid down in petition No. 86/2014 titled The Secretary Works Gilgit -Baltistan & 03 others versus Talib Shah & others. 10. 

In view of the above discussion s, in our considered view the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan cannot exercise suo moto Jurisdiction under Article 71 of The Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self -Governance) Order, 2009. 

Consequently, we convert this petition into an appeal and the same is allowed. 

Consequent thereto, the Impugned Judgment dated 11.12.2014 in Suo Moto Case No. 09/2013, passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court is set aside being passed without jurisdiction. 

The respondents or any other person, if, aggrieved may approach the proper forum /Court of Law for redressal of their grievances in accordance with law, if they so advised. 11. 

The appeal is allowed in above terms.
