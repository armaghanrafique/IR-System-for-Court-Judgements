Air Cadr e (Assistant Director General) (Raja Muhammad Aslam) (Retd). 

The learned Deputy Attorney General for Pakistan at Gilgit -Baltistan further submits that on account of shortage of regular Director, the performance of the respondent during his initial first year probation period could not be evaluated, as such, the said probation period extended to further period of one year as extendable under relevant service rules which is also mentioned in the Para -2 of the appointment letter of the respondent. 

He also submits that during second probationary period while evaluating the performance of the respondent it revealed that the performance of the respondent was poor and below the minimum desire d standards as he was taking least interest in the affairs of the Department due to which his department suffered a lot. 

After this observation show cause notices and warning had been served upon the respondent. 

The respondent was given opportunities to improve his performance but he could not do so. 

He was also given right of

5 representation but again the respondent in vain to satisfy the competent authorities. 

Consequently, the service of the respondent was terminated being the respondent not fit and suitable for his job. 

He also submits that the res pondent feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the termination order filed Writ Petition No. 28/2012 before the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Cou rt. 

Wherein, the learned Chief Court accepted the Writ Petition of the respondent without considering the legal points raised by the petitioner. 

Hence, the impugned judgment is not tenable and liable to be set aside being the said is the result of misconception of law and misreading of the facts of the case. 

He finally submits that the impugned judgment dated 23.06.2011 in Writ Petition No. 28/2012 may pleased be set aside to meet the ends of justice. 

On the other hand, Mr. 

Amjad Hussain learned counsel for the respondent contends that the appointment of the respondent against the post of Secretary DASB was on permanent basis from his initial appointment and the respondent accordingly served his department with effect from 03.12.2009 to 14.12.2011 with enthusiasm. 

He also contends that the respondent was kept on probation for a period of one year extendable f or further period of one year which was expired on 03.12.2011 and the respondent had successfully completed his mandatory period of two years probation and he had become permanent employee of Pakistan Armed Service Board (P ASB). 

He contends that on 14.12.2011 the petitioner No. 02 surreptitiously passed impugned termination order dated

6 14.12.2011 in contrary to the mandatory provision of service law i.e. 

Efficiency And Discipline Rule 1975. 

The respondent was entitled to be heard by the inquiry offic er and also entitled to defend the allegation/charges, if any, before issuance of termination order by the petitioners. 

The learned counsel for the respondent also contends that no opportunity had been given to the respondent and his services were terminat ed on the basis of liking and disliking without issuing any show cause notice and assigning any reason thereto. 

The petitioners violated the mandatory provisions of law while issuing the said termination order. 

The said termination order was issued illegally and without lawful authority. 

He finally contends that the learned Chief Court has rightly set aside the said termination order in accordance with law and facts on record. 

The impugned judgment dated 23.06.2014 in Writ Petition 28/2012 passed by the learned Chief Court based on facts and law therefore, the same is tenable and no interference is warranted. 

He contends that this Hon’ble court may please d be dismiss the appeal of the petitioners with cost and the impugned judgment may kindly be main tained. 

We have heard both the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the record and gone through the impugned Judgment dated 23.06.2014, in Writ Petition NO. 28/2012, passed by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan as well as the impugned termination order No. 0151/4/PASB -2 dated 14.12.2014.
