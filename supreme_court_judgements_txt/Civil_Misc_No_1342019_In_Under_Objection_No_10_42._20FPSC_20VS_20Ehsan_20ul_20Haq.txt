============================================================

2 Wazir Shakil Ahmed, J ----- The above tilted matter was put up before us on 29.06.2020, for preliminary hearing and the same was adjourned for today i.e. 01.07.2020, as the learned Deputy Attorney General Pakistan for Gilgit -Baltistan, apprised the Court that the institution of the matter in hand was not within his knowledge, i t was also brought into the notice of this Court that despite having knowledge/information, the Assistant Director FPSC, failed to mark his attendance before this Court on appointed date i.e. 29.06.2020, so the matter was fixed for today i.e. 01.07.2020. 2. 

The learned Deputy Attorney General Pakistan for Gilgit -Baltistan, while arguing her matter, opted to read the concluding paras of the impugned judgment/order dated 27.03.2019, of the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan, which resulted into the filin g of the present petition. 3. 

Brief facts of the case are that the answering respondent was one of 213 candidates, who qualified the test conducted by the present petitioner i.e. 

Federal Public Service Commission, for the posts of Assistant Commissioner, Section Officer, Project Manager, Tehsildar and Development Officer. 

There were 28 vacant posts of categories mentioned above along with 05 quota seats reserved for women and minorities. 

The name of the respondent was not reflected in the final list of 33 candidates who were recommended for appointment on the basis of their securing arks in the written test/viva voce, being below merit than other qualified candidates, which culminated into the filing of writ petition bearing No. 189/2018, before the

3 learn ed Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan, wherein the present respondent called in question the recommendation of some selected female candidates having being secured less marks as compared to the present respondent. 4. 

During the pendency of the said writ petitio n the name of the present respondent was also recommended by the present petitioner named above, as some one or two successful candidates did not opt to join the posts for which they were held entitled to. 5. 

Keeping in view the developed scenario, the l earned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan was apprised about the fact that not a single person from minorities had applied for rec ruitment against any of the reserved posts for the minorities. 

Resulting which the posts against the quota of minorities is still va cant in order to advertise the same again. 6. 

It is an admitted state of fact that in the whole area of Gilgit -Baltistan, there is no permanent resident having minority status, resulting which not a single person can be named as a successful candidate o f any of the competitive examination against the minority quota. 7. 

We are of the firm opinion that no fruitful purpose shall be served by holding the post against minority quota in Gilgit -Baltistan, because of the hard fact mentioned above that there is no existence of any minority in all the 10 D istricts of Gilgit -Baltistan. 8. 

So the learned Division Bench Chief Court Gilgit - Baltistan has not committed any illegality and irregularity by

4 directing to appoint the present respondent as Tehslidar against the vacant post, failing which it was also decided that he may be appointed against any already vacant post of minorities. 9. 

On the peculiar circumstances of the present case where the present respondent is admittedly already working as Naib Tehsildar, who has gained ample experience in the relevant field and he has got a strong case for appointment as Tehsildar. 10. 

We are otherwise of the opinion that the present petitioner i.e. 

Federal Public Service Commission, bitterly failed to prove their entity as an aggrieved party in the lis for that matter, the Provincial Government was indeed an aggrieved party whose petition for leave to appeal has already been dismissed being hopelessly time barred. 11. 

In the light of what has been discussed above, this petition merits nothing else than dismissal, which is accordingly ordered. 

Announced 01.07.2020 Chief Judge Judge Whether the case is fit to be reported or Not?
