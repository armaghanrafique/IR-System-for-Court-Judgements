2 2 1. 

Brief facts giving r ise to the present appeals are that on e sajjad Hussai n A.S.I./Incharge Police Check Post Danyore lodged a complaint with Police Station Air Port Gi lgit alleging therein that on 0 3-08-2004 one Faisal Shahzad driver of a Truck reported the matter to Danyore Police Chowki that on the night of occurrence he along -with co -driver Rahimullah and cleaner of Truck No. 

LSC 3082, Babar Nawaz was on his way to R awalpindi from Hunza and when his truck reached near a place kno wn as Juglote Gah he having seen the ro ad blocked with stones, directed the cleaner to remove the stones and on his direction the cleaner got down from the truck and started removing the stone s from the road, in the meanwhile three armed persons suddenly appeared and started aerial firing and directed to switch off the light of the vehicle and robed a sum of Rs. 14500/- and a wrist watch and ring from him and Rs.400/ - from the co -driver. 

On his report FIR No. 156/2004 was registered with Police Station Air Port Gilgit under Section 17 Hudood Ordinance 1979. 2. 

After completion of necessar y investigation the Police report was submitted in Anti Terrorist Court Gilgit in terms of Section 173 Cr.P.C. after recording the prosecution evidence the case was transferred to Sessions Judge Gilgit on the request of District Attorney as the provisions of ATA were not attracted who entrusted the matter to Addition al Sessions J udge Gilgit for disposal. 

After com pletion of the proceeding s the Additional Session s Judge Gilgit convicted the appellants Under Section 392 Cr.P.C. for a terms of Seven Years R.I. each and imposed fine of Rs. 30,000/ -. 3. 

The appellants filed separate appeals against their convict ion while the state preferred a Revision Petition for enhancement of sentence awarded to appellants by Trial Court. 

The learned Division Bench of the Chief Court vide impugned judgment dated 26 -08-2009 dismissed the appeals against conviction and also the Revision for enhancement of sentence. 4. 

We have heard the learn ed counsel for appellants and A. 

G for the state at length, the learned counsel for the appellants at the very out set submitted that the Trial Court as well as the appellate court ha ve based their finding on the identification parade conducted in side Police Station premises under supervision of a Naib Tehsildar and two witnesses /identifie rs allegedly identified co-accused namely Saeed

3 3 Hasan and Ibrar as culprits while no identification parade was conducted to the extent of appellant Tota Jan. 

He further contended that there was no other evidence to connect the appellants with the present crime except s o called identification test as such both the learned courts below have seriously erred in conv icting the appellants in absence of sufficient evidence. 5. 

On the other hand the learned A dvocate General controverted the above submission made by learned counsel for appellants and vehemently opposed the Appeal. 

He submitted that two witness namely Baba r Nawaz and Faisal Shahzad had identified the appellants Saeed Hassan and Ibrar during identification parade and also during court proceeding. 

He stressed that the evidence of these two witnesses was sufficient for conviction of the said two appellants so far as the other appellant namely Tota Jan is concerned the prosecution had successfully recovered the incriminating articles and looted cash from his possession. 

He went on saying that the Trail Court as well as Chief Court ha ve rightly convicted the appe llants. 6. 

After hearing the arguments on both sides and perusal of the record we have come to the conclusion that the prosecution case solely rested on the identification parade as the other evidence regarding recovery of looted amount an d the weap ons has already been discarded /rejected by the learned court s below as such it need not be discussed. 7. 

Admittedly the occurrence took place durin g a dark mid night in a place fa r from the local population, according to the statement s of driver and cleaner i.e PW- 7,8 and 9 when they reached in the area of Jaglote Gah at about 23:30 hours where they found the road having been blocked by the rocks on the road, stopped the tru ck and PW - 9 on the directives of PW -8 got down from the truck in order to remove the stones/rocks, mean while accused opened aerial firing and looted an amount of Rs.14500/= from the pocket of PW - 8 and articles from PW -9. 

However PW -7 disclosed at the time of examination in Chief before the tr ial court that the looted amount was Rs.3000/ - only and there after the accused fled away from the scene of occurrence and the complainant and witness es proceed towards police check post to lodge the complain t. 

The witness also deposed before the trail court that it was dark on the night of occurrence a nd there was no moon light. 

The head lights of the truck

============================================================

============================================================

4 4 were also stated to be off when the accused came at the site of occurrence and the only source of identification of accused according to witnesses was dim light of upper side light of truck. 8. 

The p rosecution examined 10 witnesses and as stated earlier the trial court as well as the Hon’ble Chief Court based their finding/conviction on the sta tement of PW-8, 9 and PW -5. 

PW -8 and 9 are Driver and Conductor of the truck who allegedly identified the appellant s during the identification test carried out in police station Airport. 

While PW -5 is a Naib Tehsildar in whose supervision the iden tification parade was conducted. 9. 

It is strange that the statement of co -driver of truck namely Rahimullah PW-7 was neither discussed nor considered by the two courts below. 

The said witness despite of his presence at the time of occurrence was not called by the prosecution to participate the identification parade. 

This witness during Re -Examination categorically state d that “I do not charge the accused present in court ”. 10. 

The only piece of evidence on the basis of which the appellants were convicted is the identification parade conducted under the supervision of PW -5 in the premises of police station Air Port, admittedly the appellant Ibrar and Saeed were arrested by the Police on 16/08/2004 but their identification parade was held on 23/08/2004. 

This delay of 7 days in identification parade goes un -explained. 

According to Rule 26 -32 of Police Rules 1934 and guid elines laid d own by Superior Judiciary of Pakistan the identification parade is required to be carried out as soon as possible without any delay and soon after the arrest of suspect. 

But the prosecution failed to carryout the same soon after the arrest of the suspect in the present case. 11. 

The identification parade conducted under supervision of PW -5 who happened to be a Naib Tehsildar at the time of holding of identification parade, the prosecution examined him as PW -5 who deposed that on the directi ves of SDM Gilgit, he conducted the identification parade in Police Station Airport on 23 -08-2004 wherein appellant Saeed and Ibrar were identified by PW -8 and 9 and after completion of process of identification parade he prepared report/memo ex -PW-5/1, on cr oss examination he admitted that he was Naib Tehsildar at that time, participants/dummies were not wearing similar dress, their ages were also different,

============================================================

============================================================

5 5 some of dummies were clean shaved and others having beard, identifier were present in the office of S. 

H.O prior to his arrival in Police Station and suspect could also be seen in the lock up from the window of office of S.H.O. 

He though did not mention the number of dummies mixed in the identification parade however according to ex - PW-5/1, the number of du mmies is ten. 

While the number of identifier s in column NO. 5 form 26 –(32) is mentioned as four. 12. 

In absence of any corroborative piece of evidence the prosecution should have carried out the identification parade in accordance with procedure/criteria laid down in section 26 rule 32 of Police Rules or guidelines laid down by superior courts of the country but unfortunately the prosecution adopted a novel procedure un warranted in law while holding the identification parade. 

No law authorizes an investig ator to hold the identification parade in side the Police Station especially when the suspects/ accused were visible from the office of SHO, where the identifiers were made seated and under these circumstances the possibility to have seen the accused by the identifiers before identification parade cannot be ruled out. 

The concerned SHO or investigating officer was required to detain the accused/appellants in jail without wasting a single moment and without showing them to identifiers. 

The investigating agenc y instead of holding the identification parade in a fair and transparent manner adopted a self styled procedure for identification parade, inside the premises of Police Station in presence of Naib Tehsildar instead of a Magistrate first class. 

The du mmies intermingled with two accused in the joint identification parade as per ex -PW-5/1, were ten while as per section 26.32 (d) 9 or 10 dummies of similar dress and of the same religion, age and social status are required to be intermingled with one suspect/acc used but the same is not done in the present case. 

The identifier also failed to attribute any role to the accused/suspect at the time of identification parade. 13. 

We have also gone through the judgment of Chief Court the learned Chief Court has based its finding mainly on the identification parade and has relied upon the statement of PW -8 and 9 and has held that these two witness being honest and disinterested their statements are reliable, without de eply minuting the statement of these two witness es it is sufficient to discard their statement quo identification of the

============================================================

============================================================

6 6 appellant in a dark night merely on dim light of the truck especially when the witnesses were in a condition of fear to their lives. 

Even if it is presumed that the said witnesses are symbol s of truth their statements are not sufficient for conviction because of non transparent rather illegal procedure adopted by the investigator while conducting the identification parade as discussed above and in absence of other material. 

In the light of a bove discussion we have come to the conclusion that the prosecution has failed to establish the guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. 

It is well established principle that every doubt which may arise would go in favour of accused as such convict ion of the appellants in given circumstances is not sustainable. 

Consequently we accept these appeals, set aside the impugned judgment of lear ned Chief Court dated 26 -8-2009 and judgment dated 09-4-2008 passed by Additional Session Judge Gilgit and acquit the appellants from the charge giving them benefit of doubt, our s hort order by virtue of which the appeal s were accepted and the appellants were released is treated as part of this judgment.
