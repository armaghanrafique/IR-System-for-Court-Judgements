We have heard the learned counsel for respective par ties at length, perused the record of case file and gone through the impugned judgment dated 12.11.2013 passed by the learned Chief Court as well as the judgments/dec rees passed by the courts below and in our considered view the judgment passed by the lear ned First Appellate Court as well as impugned judgment passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court are well founded.
