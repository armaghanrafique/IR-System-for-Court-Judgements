The respondent/accused being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment of the learned Trial Court filed Criminal Appeal No. 01/2013 in the learned Chief Court which upon hearing was allowed the appeal by majority decision. 6. 

The learned Advocate General submits that it was a promptly lodged FIR against the respondent/accused. 

The allegations leveled against the respondent have been substantiated by the Prosecution through direct evidence, extra judicial confession, confessional statement of the accused, circumstantial evidence and explosive exper t report. 

Per learned Advocate General, the respondent confessed the crime during recording of his statement. 

The site plan of the place of occurrence has been prepared on the pointation of the respondent/accused in presence of the Magistrate. 

He submits t hat the prosecution has proved its case against the respondent beyond reasonable doubts which was rightly been appreciated by the learned Trial Court which was reversed by the learned Chief Court. 

Per learned Advocate General, the learned Chief Court faile d to appreciate the prosecution evidence and other material on record while passing the impugned judgment which is not sustainable. 7. 

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent supports the impugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court. 

He contends that no eye witness supported the prosecution case. 

Admittedly, it was dark at the place of occurrence. 

The eye witnesses have not seen anybody throwing

============================================================

============================================================

5 explosive substance from car being complete dark. 

Similarly, there is not an iota of evidence against the respondent which connect him with the commission of crime. 

Per learned counsel, the case a gainst the respondent is false and fabricated one. 

The prosecution relied upon the confessional statement of the respondent recorded under Section 21 -H of Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997. 

In presence of eye witnesses who have not seen and identified the respondent while committing the offence such confession loses its credibility. 

He contends that the co -accused namely Asif Khan and Zahid Hussain who hav e been attributed the same role were acqui tted by the learned Trial Court. 

Per learned counsel, the respondent has also entitled for acquittal on the “Principle of Consistency”. 

Further, t he State did not file any acquittal appeal against them in the learned Chief Court. 

Likewise, another co -accused i.e. 

Samiullah who as per prosecution supplied the grenade to another absconder accused namely Arif -ud-Din was acquitted by the learned trial court in absentia. 

He submits that the prosecution has miserab ly failed to prove its case against the respon dent beyond any shadow of doubt. 

The judgment of the learned Trial Court was passed contrary to the facts and law which was not sustainable which was rightly been set aside by the learned Chief Court. 8. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, appraised the prosecution evidence, perused the other material on record of the case file and gone through the impugned judgment as well as judgment passed by the learned

6 Trial Court. 

Admittedly, no eye witness supported the prosecution case. 

The prosecution miserably failed to prove the case against the respondent beyond reasonable doubt. 

In our considered view, the impugned judgment is well reasoned and well founded and n o interference is warranted into it. 

The learned Advocate General also could not point out any infirmity and mis -appreciation of evidence in the impugned judgment. 9. 

In view of the above discussions, we dismiss this appeal. 

Consequently, the impugned judgment dated 2 2.09.2017 passed by the learned Chief Court is maintained. 10. 

The appeal is dismissed in above terms.
