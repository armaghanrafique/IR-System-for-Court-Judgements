Committee will submit progress report on the subject matters for our perusal in chamber. 

This is not the function of this court to control the administrative affairs of the departments of Government of Gilgit -Baltistan or interfere in the policy matter of the Government, rather the court being custodian of legal rights of the people may interfere in the matters which involve public rights. 

There is general compla int of undue favour in public projects and poor performance of WASA and works Department of Gilgit -Baltistan which are responsible to maintain water Supply Schemes and public roads etc. 

The Government incurred huge development and underevelopment expenditu re for the improvement of the roads and water supply scheme etc but this is sad that due to the inefficiency of these departments no visible improvement is made in the projects of public utility, as a result thereof, the public money and time, without any substantial work useful to a common person go waste. 

Keeping in view the poor performance of these departments, it will be appropriate to observe that the Chief Secretary while taking notice of the situation, may propose to the higher authorities for the e stablishment of an independent development authority for the development of Gilgit - Baltistan in the public interest.
