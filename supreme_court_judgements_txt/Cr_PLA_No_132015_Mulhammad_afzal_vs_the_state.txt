He a dmitted that he alongwith the co -accused opened fire with his 30 bore Pistol No. 636 upon the deceased Rash Khan. 

He also contended that crime empties and pistol has recovered from them and the said found matching with the pistol as per report of ballist ic expert.

He also contended that the learned Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan in C r. 

Misc. 

No.51/2015 vide order dated 29.05.2015 has granted b ail to the respondent NO.1 against the facts law and material available on the record of this case. 

The learned Chief Court, Gilgit - Baltistan has not applied its judicial mind to the facts i.e. recovery of crime weapon, which was effected on the pontation of the petitoner, as the same is admissible under Order 38 of Qanoon -e-Shahadat.

There are sufficient materials available to believe that the respondent No. 

I and co -accused committed the murder of Rash Khan.

granted by the learned Chief Court was required to be cancelled as provide under S ection 5 of Section 497 Cr. 

PC. 

We heard the learned Advocate General Gilgit - Baltistan, perused the case file and the m aterial available on the record. it is admitted position that petitoner and other co - accused were not nominated in the FIR and admittedly the statements of the PWs were also recorded after and unexplained delay of 05 days. 

There is no eye witness of this brutal murder as well except lastly seen deceased Rash Khan with petitioner and co -accused. 

The recovery of the alleged crime weapon although effected on the pointation of the co - accused Alam Zaib but after unexplained delay of 11 days. 

Admittedly no independent person of the locality was associated to witness the search, no explanation for not associating the witness of locality for search of the house of co-accused Alam Zaib on his pointation, though the same were available. 

No infirmity and illegality has b een pointed out by the learned Advocate General Gilgit - Baltistan in the impugned order dated 19.06.2015 in Cr. 

Misc. 

No. 51/2015, passed by the learned Chief Court, Gilgit - Baltistan. 

The learned Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan rightly held that in view of the above,the case of the petitoner has become a case of further inqauiry, subsequently, he was granted bail. 

In our considered opinion no interference is waranted in the impugned order dated 19.06.2015, passed by
