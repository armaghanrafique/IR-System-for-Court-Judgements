It is not disputed that the proceedings of the suit have almost been completed by the learned Trial Court.

As per record of the case, the petitioners are intentionally using delaying tactics in order to prolong their possession on the disputed property. 

As per averments of the respondents the application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC filed by the petitioners was barred by time for a period of 05 months. 3. 

The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the Civil Suit filed by the respondents was conducted through attorney on behalf of the petitioners who was continuously appearing in the learned Trial Court.
