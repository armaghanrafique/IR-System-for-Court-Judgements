Court that u ntil the Central Jail is constructed the condition of existing Jails in Gilgit -Baltistan will be improved reasonably with the provision of all necessary facilities. 

The perusal of reports of the learned District and Sessions Judges would show that even ba sic needs of life are not available to the prisoners so much so they are not being provided the facility of medical checkup and aid in emergency due to the non -availability of transport and for the same reason the prisoners are not brought to the Courts in time as a result of which delay is caused in their trials. 

The Home Secretary has given assurance for providing transport on priority to Jail authorities to avoid delay in the trial of the prisoners and to shift them to hospital for medical aid in case of need. 

The reports of learned District and Sessions Judges would also show that Jail administration has no concept of right of prisoners as human being and controlling authorities in the government are also least bothered about the problems of prisoners. 

The non -observance of the instructions contained i n Jail Manual and prison rules in respect of the right and facilities to be provided to prisoners is not only violation of human rights but also is a grave legal and constitutional violation. 

The prisoners are human being and subject to law are entitled to the fair and equal treatment in respect of their rights as citizens under the law and Constitution. 

Consequently for improvement of poor condition and reformation of Jails we direct: (i) The District and Sessions Judges and Deputy Commissioner of all di stricts in Gilgit -Baltistan will pay regular monthly visit to the Jails and issue necessary instructions in the complaints 01" the prisoners. 

The District and Sessions Judge will also ensure that prisoners arc provided the basic facilities of life as point ed out in the report of the Home Secretary. (ii) The trial of under trial prisoners in detention must be conducted on priority to avoid delay and the District and Sessions Judges should ensure that trials on commencement must proceed day to day withou t grant of unnecessary or long adjournments.

implementation of Jail Manual/Rules in letter and spirit as a basic requirement for reformation. 

This has been noticed that PWD B&R Division in Gilgit -Baltistan usually provides facility of advance money to the Contractors in the name of mobilization adva nce and Contractors without doing any work unnecessary delay the projects. 

This practice being against the ^public interest and exchequer must not be continued in routine or as an essential obligation of department and must be discouraged.
