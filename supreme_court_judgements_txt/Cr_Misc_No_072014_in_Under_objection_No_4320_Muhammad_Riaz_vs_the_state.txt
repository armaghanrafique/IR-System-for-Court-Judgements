the matter through the elders and notables of the area and an application has also been moved in this Court in this regard. 

This Court v ide order4 dated 19.08.2014 directed the trial Court i.e. 

Additional District and Session Judge Chilas to inquire into the matter regarding the genuin eness of the compromise between the parties. 

The Additional Sessions Diamer Chilas complied with the order of this Court and recorded the statements of the parties and submitted his recommendation to this Court vide his report dated 28 -08-2014. 

IN his order the additional Sessions Judge District Diamer has confirmed the genuineness of the compromise between th e parties and the complainant party has pardoned the accused for the sake of Almighty Allah. 

He further reports that the complainant party has no objection if the convicted party is acquitted on the basis of the said compromise. 

The Trial Court has als o checked the identities and scrutinized the photocopies of the National Identity Cards ( NICs) and has also placed the said copies on the file. 

In this circumstance, we also accept the said compromise to be genuine. 

However, the conviction under 13 Armed Ordinance whereby the convict has been convicted for 07 years rigorous imprisonment in addition of fine amounting to Rs. 5000/=. 

In this regard Counsel for the parties pleaded that the accused has spent 5 years and 08 months in the judicial loc- up. 

The same may be considered in his favour. 

We deem it proper that the period of 05 years and 08 month is enough time spent behind bar the remaining period is deemed to have been undergone. 

However, the fine of Rs. 5000/ = stands as it is. 

The same shall be deposited in the Government treasury and the challan shall be placed on the record of this Court. 

The convicted person i.e. 

Muhammad Riaz is acquitted from the charge of murder under Section302/34 vide FIR No. 02/2008 Police Station Thore and t he conviction under Section 13 A.O.Vide FIR No. 03/2008 Police Station Thore Tehsil Chilas District Diamer in the case titled State versus Muhammad Riaz etc vide order date 11 -09-2013 passed by the Gilgit - Baltistan Chief Court will deemed to have been se rved.
