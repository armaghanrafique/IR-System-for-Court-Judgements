3 2. 

The learned Advocate General alongwith Mr. 

Johar Ali Khan legal Adviser, Education Department Gilgit -Baltistan submits that the order of the learned Trial Court was passed in accordance with the law and the appointment letter was illegal, void and without any lawful authority. 

They further submit that the person who issued the appointment letters was not competent officer to issue the same. 

They further submit that the orde r of the learned Trial Court was upheld by the learned District Judge but the same was reversed by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan. 

They further submit that the learned Trial Court dismissed the application under Order 39 Rule (1) & (2) read with Section 151 CPC. 

They further submit that the learned Trial Court upon hearing rejected the plaint under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. 3. 

They further submit that the learned District Judge on appeal dismissed the application for grant of temporary injunction fil ed by the respondents and the Deputy Commissioner Ghanche was directed to continue the recovery proceedings. 

They further submit that the proceedings regarding rejection of plaint under Order 7 Rule 11 kept alive which was still pending adjudication. 

They also submit that the respondent No. 01 Muhammad Iqbal filed Civil Review No. 32/2012 and Civil Review No. 27/2012 filed by Sonia D/o Ghulam Abbas and upon hearing both the parties the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court converted the review applications into a Writ Petition and the same was allowed. 

They further submit that the impugned judgment passed

============================================================

4 by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court without perusing the records and misreading /non -reading of the facts of case, therefore, the sam e is not tenabl e and liable to set aside. 4. 

On the other hand the learned counsels for the respondents support the impugned judgment. 

They contend that the Education Department Ghanche had some vacant posts of BPS - 14, BPS -16, Assistant Head Master and Head Master (BPS -18) created either freshly or fallen vacant due to retirement of some teachers in the year 2011 and 2012. 

They further contend that through internal inspections and scrutiny of service record of teachers and office staff it transpired that during the perio d of 2011 -12 the respondents have been appointed in BPS -09 by the then Director Education Baltistan Region in the vacant posts of teachers from BPS -14 to 19. 

They further contend that the services of the respondents were terminated neither serving them wit h a show cause notice nor they were afforded an opportunity of being heard. 

They further contend that the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court has rightly allowed the Writ Petition of the respondent s vide judgment dated 23.05.2013 which is in accordance wi th law and facts of the case, hence, no interference is warranted into it and the same is required to be maintained to meet the ends of justice. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned judgment dated 23.05.2013 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court. 

Consequently, we converted
