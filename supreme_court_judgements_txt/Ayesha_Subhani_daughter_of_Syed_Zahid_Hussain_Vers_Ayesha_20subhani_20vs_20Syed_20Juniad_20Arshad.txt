has opted not to appear today. 

The notice was also served upon to the Investigation Officer (I.O) Mr. 

Ashir Aroon on 11.08.2017 who has also not opted to appear today. 

The reason shown by hi m for not attending this court today is not acceptable rather contemptuous in nature. 

The reasons explained by Assistant Director (Legal) at Gilgit for his not appearance are not acceptable. 2. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the respondent/accused Syed Junaid Arshad, is a high ranked police officer and his all colleagues are serving in Cyber Crime Circle Wing FIA. 

The FIA inspite of registration of case on 09.06.2017 have not arrested him till 05.07.2017 being cognizable offence rathe r they facilitated him to get ad -interim bail and now providing opportunity enabling him to get the FIR cancelled. 

Per learned counsel the respondent/accused has not joined the investigation. 

The poor victim lady (complainant) was kept in dark regarding gr anting the ad-interim bail to the accused/respondent AIG Syed Junaid Arshad. 

Further, Syed Diladar Hussain, Assistant Director (Legal) Anti-Corruption Circle, FIA Gilgit has no knowledge about his joining of investigation at Lahore or any progress of the c ase. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the extra - ordinary concession of ad -interim Transit bail for “Five Weeks” given by learned Chief Court is unprecedented and not tenable in law. 

Per learned counsel there is no provision in la w to grant ad - interim transit bail. 

He submits that the “transit remand” and bail can be granted after the arrest of the accused as provided under

The Protected pre -arrest bail can also be granted under Section 498 Cr. 

P.C enabling the petitioner to surrender in the competent court of law in other province. 

The respondent AIG Syed Junaid Arshad has neither prayed for Pre -arrest or Protected bail nor the learned Chief Court at Gilgit has converted his petition into a Protective or Pre - arrest bail. 

He prayed that impugned order dated 05.07.2017 in Criminal Misc. 

No. 91/2017 passed by learned Chief Court is not sustainable and liable t o be set aside. 3. 

Neither learned Deputy Attorney General for Pakistan, Gilgit nor the Assistant Director (Legal) Crime Wing FIA, Gilgit have controverted the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner. 4.
