This petition for leave to appeal has arisen out of the impugned judgment dated 19.04.2017 passed by the learned Chief Court whereby the Writ Petition filed by the petitioners was partially allowed prospectively, however, the perks & privileges have not been granted retrospectively.

2 appeal. 

This court vide order dated 16.06.2017 issued notices to the respondents and the case is heard today. 2. 

Briefly, the facts of the case are that the petitioners are performing their duties as Advocate General, Additional Advocate General, Deputy Advocate s General and Assistant Advocate General Gilgit -Baltistan respectively. 

The petitioners filed Writ Petition No. 96/2016 in the learned Chief Court contending therein that they were/ are entitled for the perks & privileges and other monetary benefits at par with their counterp arts of the four (04) Provinces of Pakistan as we ll as Azad Jamu & Kashmir (AJK). 

The petitioners earlier filed departmental appeal to the competent authorities but the respondents granted only Rs. 50,000/ - per month to the petitioner No. 01, Rs. 25,000/ - per month to the petitioner No. 02 and Rs. 20,000/ - to the petitioner No. 03 & 04 as non -practicing allow ance vide order dated 12.05.2016. 

Whereafter the petitioners were constrained to file the said Writ Petition in the learned Chief Court claiming for equal treatment under Article s 17, 19, 25 & 27 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 an d Article 19, 25 & 27 of The Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009. 

The said Writ Petition was partially allowed with prospective effect, however, the said perks & Privileges have not been granted retrospectively. 3. 

The learned cou nsel for the petitioners submits that after promulgation of The Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009, the Government of Pakistan has been

============================================================

3 pleased to upgrade and equate all the Government Organizations in Gilgit -Baltistan at par with their counter parts in all the four (04) Provinces of Pakistan including Azad Jamu & Kashmir (AJK). 

Whereas the petitioners have been discriminated. 

Per learned counsel, the posts of the petitioner No. 01 to 03 are purely Constitutional Posts which can not be placed in any “Basic Pay Scale”. 

The posts of petitioner No. 04, however, can be placed in BPS-19 at par with the rest of provinces of the country. 

He further submits that the learned Advocate General has the status of Provincial Minister in all the provinces of Pakistan. 

He is entitled for all the perks & privileges which have been granted by the rest of the Provinces particularly at par with the Province of Punjab. 

Similarly, the petitioner No. 02, 03 & 04 are also entitled for all the perks & privileges at par with the Province of Punjab. 

He submits that there is no financial constraints as mentioned in the impugned judgment. 

The Government of Gilgit -Baltistan has all the resources to pay the said monetary benefits to the petitioners. 

Although the W rit Petition filed by the petitioners was partially allowed by the learned Chief Court yet the back benefits were declined to them which is against the spirit of law and the rule of consistency. 4. 

On the other hand, Malik Shafqat Wali senior Advocate, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Provincial Government of Gilgit -Baltistan contends that the petitioners have no cause of action and locus standi to file the Writ Petition in the learned Chief Court against its own Government. 

At the time of their

============================================================

============================================================

4 appointments for the respective posts, the petitioners have voluntarily accepted the terms & conditions of their services. 

The petitioners were/ are estopped by law from filing the said Writ Petition. 

Per learned counsel, the petitioner No. 02 to 04 are the Civil Servants and they are getting their pay & allowances as per their Basic Pay Scales. 

The Government of Gilgit -Baltistan is dependent on the Federal Government in Financial matter s. 

The Gilgit -Baltistan Government has no separate budget to meet with the expenditure on account of extraordinary benefits as granted to the petitioners by the learned Chief Court, hence, not tenable in law. 

He prays that the impugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court be set aside in circumstances. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned judgment dated 19.04.2017 passed by the learned Chief Court. 

The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Provincial Government of Gilgit -Baltistan could not point out any infirmity or illegality except the financial constrain ts in the impugned judgment. 

In our considered view, the petitioners were not treated equally amongst equals i.e. at par with their counterparts in other four pr ovinces. 6. 

In view of the above discussions, we convert b oth the petitions into appeals, consequently, t he Civil Appeal No. 46/2017 in (CPLA No. 78/2017) filed by the petitioners is disposed off with modifications whereas the Civil Appeal No. 47 /2017 (in CPLA.
