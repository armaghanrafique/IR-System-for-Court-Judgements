(This option has no bearing on Military pension received by Officer out of Defence Budget).” The Deputy Auditor General (Provincial Audit) in support thereof has placed reliance on the notifications and the circulars issued on the subject by the government of Pakistan and we having carefully perused the report of Deputy Auditor General in the light of record have found that the statement of account earlier submitted by KIU and Accountant General Pakistan Revenue Gilgit were not correctly prepared and the arrears of pay and allowances actually payable to the petitioner were wrongly calculated.

The Deputy Auditor General (Provincial Audit) Islamabad rectifying the error of miscalculation of the amount of claim in the previous statements of account has submitted report (Mark B) on the basis of last pay drawn of the petition in the service of KIU. 

This report and statement of account is treated as part of record and the judgment under review is accordingly modified. 

The petitioner Late Lt. 

Col Arshad Mehmood the then Registrar of KIU will be paid an amount of Rs. 28 lac 78 thousand and 161 rupees as calculated by Deputy Auditor General (Provincial Audit) Islamabad in his report dated 25-05-2010 (Mark B) in respect of arrears of his pay and allowances for the period from 01-01-2005 to 15-06-2009. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner at this stage has submitted that since KIU or the Provincial Government has not yet taken any step for implementation of the judgment of this court for payment of the claim of Petitioner therefor direction may be given to the respondents for the payment of claim on priority without loss of further time. 

The request being genuine we direct that the Chief Secretary Government of Gilgit Baltisan will ensure that payment of claim is made within a month. 

The compliance report will be submitted to the Registrar of this Court. 

This review petition with above direction and modification in the judgment is allowed and disposed of accordingly.
