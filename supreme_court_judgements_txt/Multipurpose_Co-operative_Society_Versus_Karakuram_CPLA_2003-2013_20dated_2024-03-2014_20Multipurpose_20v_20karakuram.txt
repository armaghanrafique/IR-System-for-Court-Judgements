Shorn of unnecessary facts, the Karrakuram Cooperative Bank Limited though its General Manager, Gilgit instituted a suit on 05.02.2006 in the Court of Civil Judge 1st Class Gilgit for the recovery of Rs. 5,23,709/ - (Rupees Five Lac, Twenty Three Thousands, Seve n Hundreds and Nine Only) outstanding against the Multi Purposes Cooperative Society, Jagir Basin, Gilgit though its representatives i.e. 

Petitioners No. 1 and 2. 3. 

The suit later on was transferred to the Court of Special Judge Customs & Judge Banking Court, Gilgit -Baltistan, Gilgit for its hearing and adjudication. 

The learned Special Judge after hearing the parities decreed the suit vide Judgment dated 10.11.2012. 4. 

The petitioners feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied, called in question the order dated 10.11. 2012, passed by the learned Special Judge, through Writ Petition bearing No. 91/2012 in the Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan which came up for hearing before the learned Division Bench of the Hon’ble Chief Court.

The learned couns el for the petitioner has been h eard at length. 6. 

The perusal of the record clearly reveals that the petitioners had made an application to obtain the copy o f the impugned order on 18.12.2012 and copy was prepared on the same date i.e. 18.12.2012 and the same was received by the petitioner on 28.01. 2013.

3 order. 

The petitioner on 28.03.2013 filed the instant petition before this court. 7. 

In view of Order XIII, Rule 1 of Supreme Appellate Court Rules, 2008, the petition was required to be filed within 60 days excluding the necessary period c onsumed in obtaining the copy. 

Keeping in view all the se dates, the instant petition was file d before this Court with a delay of about 41 days. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner when confronted with the situation, he could not explain anything with re gard to the filing of the petition with a delay of 41 days. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner was asked as to whether he has filed any application for the condonation of delay, he replied very frankly that he did not file any application requesting th erein for condonation of delay. 8. 

It is settled by now that if any aggrieved party does not file the case within the prescribed period by law, it creates a valuable legal right in favour of the other party which can not be taken away casually. 9. 

The present p etition is awfully time bared and meanwhile a valuable right has accrued to the other party. 10. 

In view of what has been discussed above, the petition in hand is dismissed and the leave to appeal is refused.
