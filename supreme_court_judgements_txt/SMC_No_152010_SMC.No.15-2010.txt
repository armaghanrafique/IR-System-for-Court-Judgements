This paragraph further provides that until such rights and privileges are so determined, a Judge shall be entitled to such privileges and r ights including a right to receive pension to which a Judge was entitled immediately before the commencing day. 

There is no ambiguity in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Fifth Schedule because paragraph 3 provides for a minimum and a maximum pension payable to a Judg e of a high Court who has not put in less than five years of service as such Judge whereas paragraph 2 deals with the entitlement of Judges. 

In short paragraph 3 identifies a particular class of Judges, with reference to the length of service and nothing c an be spelt out that paragraph 2 has no independent implication with reference to every Judge of a High Court. 

It is thus clear that the classification of Judges was made with reference to their Length of service for the purpose of determination of their p ension at different rates mentioned therein and not for the purpose of determination of their right of pension is recognized under article 205 of the constitution. 

Conclusion: - 31. 

Before parting with this judgment, we deem it proper to point out that Chief Justice and Judges of Federal Shariat Court are also entitled to the grant of pension and pensionary benefits available to the retired Judges of the Supreme Court and high Court u nder the Constitution. 

The appointment of the Chief Justice and Judges of the Federal Shariat Court is made by the President under Article 203 -C of the Constitution and the

============================================================
PAGE 12
============================================================

terms and condition of service of the Judges of the said Court are also determined by the President, therefore, notwithstanding the fixed tenure of the Chief Justice and Judges of the Federal Shariat Court, they are entitled to the terms and conditions of service and remunerations including pension and pensionary benefits at par to the J udges of the Supreme Court and High Court, by virtue of Article 203 -C99) of the Constitution which provides as under: - 8. 

There can be no exception to the right of pension and other retirement benefits of the Chief Judge and Judges of Supreme Appellate Cou rt, recognized under Gilgit -Baltistan Governance Order 2009, but the real question requiring determination would be whether the appointment of a former judge of High Court or Supreme Court of Pakistan as Chief Judge or Judge of Supreme Appellate Court Gilg it- Baltistan is re -employment in service of Pakistan or it is an independent assignment in service of Gilgit -Baltistan. 9. 

The “Service of Gilgit -Baltistan” has been defined in Article 2(o) of Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment and self Governance) Order, 2009 as under: - “(o) service of Gilgit -Baltistan means any service, post or office in connection with the affairs of Gilgit - Baltistan including the Council, but does not include service as Chairman of the Council, governor, Speaker Deputy Speaker, Chief Minis ter, minister, federal Minister in -charge of the Council Secretariat or Advisor, Parliamentary secretary, Advisor to the Minister or member of Assembly or member of the Council” The service of Pakistan has been defined in Article 260 of Constitution of Pak istan as under: - “service of Pakistan” means any service, post or office in connection with the affairs of the Federation or of a Province, and includes an All Pakistan Service, service in the Armed Forces and any other service declared to be a service of Pakistan by or under Act of [Majlis -e-Shoora (Parliament)] or of a Provincial Assembly, but does not include service as Speaker, Deputy Speaker, Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Prime Minister, Federal minister, Minister of State, Chief Minister, provincial Min ister, [Attorney - General, [Advocate General,] Parliamentary Secretary] or [Chairman or member of a Law commission, Chairman or member of the Council of Islamic Ideology, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister, Adviser to the Prime Minister, Special Assist ant to a Chief Minister, Adviser to Chief Minister] or member of a House or a provincial Assembly;” 10. 

It is clear for the definition of service of Gilgit -Baltistan and service of Pakistan that two services are entirely independent and Judges of Supreme A ppellate Court while discharging function in connection with affairs of Gilgit -Baltistan. 

The expenditure on their pay and pension and other privileges are met from consolidated fund of Government of Gilgit -Baltistan, established

The territory of Gilgit -Baltistan notwithstanding a sovereign part of Pakistan, and not an independent dominion has been governed by different Governance models since liberation and Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment and Self Governance) Order, 2009 presently enforced to Govern Gilgit -Baltistan has been promulgated by the Government of Pakistan with the following official version. “Gilgit-Baltistan (Empowerment and Self Governance) Oder, 2009 PREFACE This edition if published officially and is an authentic version of the Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment and Self Governance) Oder, 2009. 

Gilgit -Baltistan (Northern Areas) comprising Gilgit and Baltistan region, after its liberation from the Dogra Rule in 1974, have been governed under various governance models. 

The first noticeable administrative

============================================================

============================================================

improvement came through the Northern areas Legal Framework Order, 1975 wherein major administrative, judicial and political reforms were introduced. 

To ensure more internal autonomy further democratization was done through the Northern Areas Legal Framework Order, 1994. 

The elected representatives of the people were thus taken closer to a democratic and just system. 

Amendments to the Order of 1994 were also made in 1999 and 2007. 

The present democratic government Nanking on the efforts started in 1975 and further in 1994 decided to consolidate t he democratic process further and to bring the area at par with the provinces of Pakistan. 

The prime Minister of Pakistan was therefore, pleased to constitute a high Powered Committee to evolve a system of governance under the maximum devolution of powers could be ensured but keeping in view the special status of the area and the international commitments of the Government of Pakistan. 

The KA&GB division prepared a draft Gilgit - Baltistan (Empowerment and Self Governance) Order, 2009 on the above policy pa rameters. 

The draft was improve the document. 

Finally, the Order was vetted by the Law and Justice division, Islamabad and presented to the Federal Cabinet before soliciting the approval of the President of Pakistan. 

It may be mentioned that the provisio n of Gilgit - Baltistan (Empowerment and Self Governance) Order, 2009 contain major improvement over all past efforts and may rightly be added as one of the major achievements of the present Government. 

Muhammad Ihtesham Khan Secretary Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gigit -Baltistan.” 12. 

The careful examination of Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment and Self Governance) Order, 2009 read with constitution of Pakistan, it is clear that service of Gilgit -Baltistan is entirely independent to the service of Pakistan and Gilgit -Baltistan also has complete internal independence in its all affairs. 

The special territory of Gi lgit-Baltistan having been not as such defined in the Constitution of Pakistan is not governed by the Constitution of Pakistan rather it be ing sovereign part of Pakistan has always been governed by a separate legal frame work order. 

The Supreme Appellate Court Gilgit -Baltistan has been established under Northern Areas Governance Order 1994 as highest Judicial authority in Gilgit -Baltistan wit h the status at par to the supreme Court of Pakistan in the territory of Gilgit -Baltistan. 

The matters relating to the appointment of Judges of Supreme Appellate Court and their terms and condition of service are governed by Gilgit - Baltistan (Empoerment an d Self Governance) Order, 2009 and

============================================================
PAGE 15
============================================================

their status in service of Gilgit -Baltistan is same as the Chief Justice and Judges of Supreme Court of Pakistan. 

The expenditure in respect of their pay, perks and other privileges including pension and retirement facili ties are met from the consolidated fund of Government of Gilgit -Baltistan in the same manner as the expenditure in respect of the pay, pension and other privileges including retirement benefits and facilities of Chief Justice and Judges of Supreme Court of Pakistan are met from cons olidated fund of Government of Pakistan. 

The two service have no nexus with each other, therefore, the appointment of a former Judge of the High Court or Supreme Court of Pakistan as Chief Judge or Judge of Supreme Appellate Court cannot be treated re -employment in ser vice of Pakistan or appointment in service of Gilgit -Baltistan in continuation of service of Pakistan, rather it is an independent appointment with independent right of service and consequently, a former Judge of High Court or Supreme Court of Pakistan in the service of Gilgit -Baltistan on retirement as Chief Judge or a Judge from Supreme Appellate in addition to the right of pension and retirement facilities available to him in the service of Pakistan as Judge would be entitled to the pension and other ret irement benefits without any distinction. 13. 

The appointment of Chief Justice and Judge of federal Shariat Court is made under article 203 -c of the constitution of Pakistan for fixed term and similarly appointment of an adhoc Judge in Supreme Court of Pakistan after retirement is made for a specified period under article 182 of the Constitution of Pakistan, as in the case of Judges of Supreme Appellate Court under Article 60(8) of Gilgit -Baltistan governance Order 2009. 

Therefore, tenure appointment of judges of Supreme Appellate Court is not in conflict to any provision of constitution of Pakistan or any law and consequently, a chief Judge or a Judge of Supreme Appellate Court Gilgit -Baltistan, notwithstanding appointed for a term of three years on reti rement in his own independent right would be entitled to pension and other retirement facilities. 

The net result of the above discussion is that service of Pakistan and the Service of Gilgit -Baltistan are two independent services and appointment of a perso n in service of Gilgit -Baltistan. 

Mr. 

Justice Qazi Ehsan Ullah Qureshi after retirement from service of Pakistan as Judge of Peshawar High Court was appointed as Chief Judge Supreme Appellate Court Gilgit -Baltistan in the service of Gilgit -Baltistan, there fore, he was not re -employed in service of Pakistan, rather his appointment in service of Gilgit -Baltistan was quite independent to the service of Pakistan and without prejudice to the right of pension etc. earned

============================================================
PAGE 16
============================================================

by him in service of Pakistan as Judge of High Court, he would be entitled to the pension and other privileges in his independent right as Chief Judge Supreme Appellate Court Gilgit -Baltistan. 

The appointment of the Chief Judge and Judge of Supreme Appellate Court is made by Chairman of the Counci l of Gilgit - Baltistan who is Prime Minister of Pakistan under Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment and Self Governance) Oder, 2009 and subject to laws of Pakistan made applicable in Gilgit -Baltistan. 

The government of Gilgit -Baltistan and its all institutions are functioning independently under the Legal Frame work Order i.e. 

Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment and self Governance) Order, 2009. 

The service of Gilgit -Baltistan also has entirely a separate structure and status therefore, the appointment of a person in service Gilgit -Baltistan after retirement from service of Pakistan s not re -employment or continuation of service of Pakistan and consequently the rights earned by a person in service on Pakistan and also neither the rights in two services can be amalgamated with each other nor merged in service of Pakistan by mere reason of administrative control of Prime Minister of Pakistan as Chairman or Council of Gilgit -Baltistan. 14. 

Para 16 -A of President Order No. 2 of 1997 Supreme Court Judges (Leave, Pension and p rivileges) Order, 1997 provides that where a retired Judge is appointed to or is holding a post in connection with the Federal Government or a Provincial Government, he shall be entitled to receive full pension in addition to pay, allowances and privileges of the post on which he is reemployed in accordance with the rules applicable on reemployment to retired Civil Servants. 15. 

The expression Federal or Provincial Government used in Para 16 -A above means Federal Government of Pakistan and Provincial Gover nment of a province established under the Constitution of Pakistan and a Judge on reemployment in Federal or Provincial Government is entitled to full pension in addition to the pay allowances and privileges of the post on which he is reemployed. 

The Gove rnment of Gilgit -Baltistan is not provincial Government established under the constitution of Pakistan therefore the appointment of retired Judge of High Court or Supreme Court of Pakistan as a Judge in service of Gilgit - Baltistan is not a re -employment in terms of Para 16 -A of President Order No. 2 of 1997, rather it is an appointment in service of Gilgit -Baltistan is not a post in connection with the affairs of Federal Government or Provincial Government of a Province of Pakistan, therefore, a retired Jud ge of High Court or

============================================================

============================================================

Supreme Appellate Court of Pakistan on appointment in service of Gilgit -Baltistan would be entitled to all service benefit of post held by him in the service of Gilgit -Baltistan under Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment and Self Governance) O rder, 2009 independent to his right of pension and other retirement facilities in the service of Pakistan. 

The President Order No. 2 of 1997 (Supreme Court Judges (Leave, Pension and Privileges) Order, 1997 is special law having overriding effect on the ge neral law of Pension applicable to the person in service of Pakistan and this special law has been made applicable to the Judges of Supreme Appellate Court Gilgit - Baltistan by virtue of Article 60 ( 10) of Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment and Self Governance) Order, 2009, therefore, in absence of specific provision in the above special law or in Gilgit - Baltistan (Empowerment and Self Governance) Order, 2009 to the effect that appointment of a retired Judge of high Court or Supreme Court of Pakistan as judge of Supreme Appellate Court Gilgit -Baltistan will be treated reemployment in service of Pakistan, or a post in connection with the affairs of federation, he cannot be denied or deprived of the right of pension and other retirement benefits attached with the of fice of Judge in the service of Gilgit -Baltistan. 16. 

The right of pension and other retirement benefits of the Judges of Supreme Appellate Court Gilgit -Baltistan is recognized under Article 60(10) of Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment and Self Governance) Order, 2009, Which is Self -explanatory and self executor provision in the Governance order and in absence of any provision to the contrary or in conflict to the Governance order or in the Constitution of Pakistan or in any law of Pakistan enfor ced in Gilgit -Baltistan, the interpretation of article 60 (10) of Gilgit - Baltista n Governance Order 2009 in a different manner may redundant the same and result in conflict of Laws. 

The right of pension of a Judge of Supreme Appellate Court Gilgit -Baltista n with other privileges has been. 

Acknowledged under Article 60(10) of Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment and Self Governance) Order, 2009 without any exception and consequently, Mr. 

Justice Qazi Ehsan Ullah Qureshi, former Chief Judge Supreme Appellate Court G ilgit-Baltistan would be entitled to the pension and other retirement benefits admissible to the Judges of Supreme Appellate Court President Order No. 2 of 1997, by virtue of Article 60(10) of Gilgit -Baltistan Governance Order, 2009 in his independent righ t. 17. 

The representative of AGPR Gilgit informed that Court that the representation of Mr. 

Justice Qazi Ehsan Ullah former Chief

Judge of Supreme Appellate Court for grant of pension has been accepted and he has been allowed the pension and other bene fits admissible under President Order No. 2 of 1997 by virtue of Article 60(10) of Gilgit -Baltistan (empowerment and Self Governance) Order, 2009. 18. 

In the light of foregoing discussion and conclusion, we hold that the appointment of a retired judge of High Court of Supreme Court of Pakistan as Chief Judge or a Judge of Supreme Appellate Court Gilgit -Baltistan is not reemployment in service of Pakistan or in continuation of service of Pakistan, rather his appointment is in the service of Gilgit -Baltistan and on retirement form Supreme Appellate Court Gilgit -Baltistan, such Judge notwithstanding having the right of pension and other privileges as a retired Judge of High Court or Supreme Court of Pakistan would be entitled to the pension and other retiremen t benefit in his own independent right under Article 60(10) of Gilgit -Baltistan Governance Order, 2009 and shall also be entitled to the additional facilities in terms of the Notification of adoption of President Order No. 2 of 1997 issued by the Court rep roduced in pare 7 of this Judgment and under any other law within the allocated budget of Court. 19. 

The matter relating to the right of pension and pensionary benefit of the former Chief Judge and the Judges of the Supreme Appellate Court Gilgit -Baltista n is accordingly disposed off.
