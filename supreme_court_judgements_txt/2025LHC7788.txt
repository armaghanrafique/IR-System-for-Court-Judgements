F.A.O. 

No.85740 of 2023 -3- 2023 at the rate of Rs. 85,350/ - and with 10% annual enhancement with effect from October, 2023 to November, 2023 before 08.11.2023 and to deposit the future month ly rent with 10% annual increase before 5th of each calendar month. 

On 29.11.2023 respondent filed an application under subsection (9) of section 17 of the Act claiming that the appellant had not complied with the order passed by the Addl. 

Rent Controller regarding the deposit of rent as directed on 02.11.2023 and that he had committed default in payment of arrears of rent within the stipulated period. 

The allegation was that the rent for the month of June 2023 was deposited on 20.11.2023 instead of 08.11.2 023 and that rent for the month of December, 2023 was not deposited and that the arrears of rent was not deposited in accordance with tentative determination of Rs. 6,14,520/ - on or before 08.11.2023. 

It was also observed by the Addl. 

Rent Controller that the rent for the month of June, 2023 was towards the arrears of rent which was to be deposited on or before 08.11.2023 instead it was deposited on 20.11.2023 which was default on the part of appellant.

Rent Controller had no other option except to direct

F.A.O. 

No.85740 of 2023 -4- straightaway ejectment of the appellant in terms of section 17(9) of the Act. 

Reference can be made to t he case of M. 

H. 

Mussadaq v. 

Muhammad Zafar Iqbal and another (2004 SCMR 1453 ). 6. 

On this aspect of the matter, the legal position is very clear. 

According to sub -section (9) of section17 of the Act, if the tenant fails to deposit the amount of rent before specified date or as the case may be before 5th of the month, his defence shall be stuck off. 

On its bare perusal, it is manifest that the above provisions are mandatory in nature and even one day’s delay in making the deposit would be default withi n its meaning and Rent Controller has no power to extend time and condon e the same. 

To further fortify, reference can be made to the case of Misbahullah Khan v. 

Mst. 

Memoona Taskinuddin (1995 SCMR 287 ) in which while interpreting scope of section 17 of the Act it was ruled to the effect that tentative rent order can be passed by the Rent Controller even if ground of default is not alleged for seeking eviction. 

It was also observed that punitive response shall directly visit upon non-compliance with the tentative rent order and in consequence the defence of tenant may be stuck off and even eviction can be granted. 

In Province of Punjab and others v. 

Muhammad Jalil ur Rehman (1986 SCMR 1705 ) it was observe d to the effect that the Rent Controller had no power to ignore the delay in making deposit of rent under subsection (6) of section 13 of the West Pakistan Urban Rent Restriction Ordinance (VI of 1959) which is a comparable provision. 

Similarly Muhammad Yo usaf v. 

Muhammad Bashir and others (1990 SCMR 557 ) leave to appeal was declined and petition was dismissed and it was maintained that the Rent Controller had no jurisdiction to

F.A.O. 

No.85740 of 2023 -5- condone even default of a day in making deposit of the rent on due date. 7. 

In the instant case also there was no explanation for late deposit of rent for the month of June, 2023 or non- deposit of rent for the month of December, 2023. 

So much so no reply to the application for striking off defence was filed by the appellant to explain the late deposit of rent and the default committed by him by not depositing the rent for the month of December 2023. 

In this view of the matter the order of Addl. 

Rent Controller is fair, just and in accordanc e with the jurisprudence enunciated by the superior courts. 

No ground whatsoever has been made out for interference. 8. 

Resultantly, this appeal being devoid of any merit is dismissed. (RASAAL HASAN SYED) JUDGE Approved for reporting JUDGE *Rabbani *
