The service s of the respondent herein were terminated by the competent authority vide Order No. 

SP/GZR -1(13)13920 -97/06 da ted 09.10.2006 on the main charge of having involved in Case FIR No. 18/2006 dated 29.08.2006, registered under Sections 224/223 PPC at the instance of SI/SHO of the Police Station Chatorkhand District Ghizer. 

The respondent filed a departmental appeal aga inst the said termination order before the AIG Headquarters, Police. 

The appeal was dismissed vide Order No. 

SP/GZR -1(13)/11323/07 dated 19.10.2007 passed by the appellate authority.

3 The afore -reffered petition was allowed by the Chief Court vide order dated 21.12.2011 in terms as und er: - “The petitioner has been re -instated in response to the Judgment of this Court dated 24.11.2010, which was upheld by the Supreme Appellate Court on 26.05.2011, but the respondent No. 2 in violation of Court Order without allowing back benefits. 

This petition is di sposed of with the strict direction to the respondent No. 2 for allowing back benefits to the petitioner as have been ordered by the Court. 

Petitioner can move afresh if deprived him after reasonable time. 

Petition disposed of accordingly. 

File” 4. 

The petitioner feeling aggrieved assailed aforesaid order dated 21.12.2011 in CPLA No. 06/ 2012 before this Court. 5. 

Arguing the case, the learned Advocate General Gilgit - Baltistan has submitted that the impugned ord er is against facts and record and that the Hon’ble Chief Court never applied its judici ous mind while handing down said judgment. 

He submitted further t hat the matter of payment of back benefits was left to the discretion of competent authority and as suc h, learned Chief Court could not take up the matter and thereafter, direct the payment of back benefits. 

It has been argued further that the learned Chief Court exercised its jurisdiction illegally with material irregularity and the order has been passed w ithout taking into consideration the actual controversy and as such the same is liable to be set aside. 6. 

Arguments heard and record perused. 7. 

The trend and tenor of the order dated 26.05.2011 mentioned above clearly reflects that the authority was only given the mandate to hold regular inquiry, if so desired. 

It nowhere dealt with postponement of payment of back benefits till conclusion of inquiry if so initiated against the respondent herein. 

In view of judgment menti oned supra, there

4 remains no room for doubt that the respondent is entitled to recover back benefits as per or ders of this Court dated 26.05.2011 and no exception can be taken to it. 

We have perused impugned order very carefully and found no illegality at all which may require interference. 8. 

Upshort of the whole exercise is that the impugned order is in accordance with law and never calls for any interference. 9. 

The petition is dismissed. 

Leave refused.
