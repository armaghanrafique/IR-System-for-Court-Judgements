We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned judgment as well as the judgment dated 29.06.2013 passed by the learned Trial Gilgit. 

Admittedly, No PW attributed any specific role in commission of the alleged offence. 

No material is available on record against the accused except the confessional statements of the accused recorded under Section 21 -H of Anti - Terrorism Act, 1997 which is not admissible unless corroborated by independent witness(s) or supported by strong circumstantial evidence. 

In our considered view, both the Courts below failed to consider the aforementioned facts and judgments so d elivered were the result of misreading, non -reading and mis -appreciation of the evidence on record. 

The prosecution has miserable failed to prove the case against the appellants beyond the shadow of doubt. 9. 

In view of the above discussions, this appeal was allowed and the appellant were acquitted by giving them the benefits of doubt vide our short order dated 08.05.2017. 

Consequently, the impugned judgment dated 13.11.2013 in Criminal Appeal No. 18/2013 passed by the learned Chief Court and the judgment dated 29.06.2013 in TC. 

No. 28/2009 passed by the learned Trial Court were set aside. 

These were the reasons of said short order. 10. 

The appeal is allowed in above terms.
