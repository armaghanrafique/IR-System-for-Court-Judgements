REPLY TO SHOW CAUSE NOTICE. 

Respectfully Sheweth, The undersigned submits as under: - 1. 

That on 05/10/2017 the Supreme Appellate Court Bar Association conveyed General Body meeting on the agenda, “INCOMPLETE SUPREME APPELLATE COURT AND ITS FUNCTIONING ” and the general body was attended by overwhe lming majority of its members. 2. 

That, the Majority members of the General Body of Supreme Appellate Court Bar Association after detailed deliberation opined to call for complete strike of the proceedings of Supreme Appellate Court till completion of Suprem e Appellate Court in accordance with the demands of the Lawyers community (All Bar Associations of GB), as communicated through Resolution dated 02nd June, 2017. 3. 

That, it was decided that the Supreme Appellate Court Bar Association will announce strike of the proceedings of Supreme Appellate Court in condemnation of conduct of Gilgit -Baltistan Government as well as the Federal Government. 4. 

That, as members of the Bar Association the undersigned have acted in accordance with the collective decision of the Bar Association which is not at all misleading, provoking and instigating the lawyers. 5. 

That, it has been alleged in the subject matter that the undersigned are observing unlawful strike which fact is misconceived as the strike announced by the Bar Assoc iation is lawful and for the cause of rule of law and dispensation of justice in accordance with Article 60(3) of Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009, wherein it is provided that “The Supreme Appellate Court shall consist of a Chie f Judge to be known as Chief Judge of Gilgit -Baltistan and two other judges”. 6. 

That, in the above view of the matter, it is seriously felt that the Court is incomplete for the last about one year and despite repeated Resolutions passed by the Bar Associati on of Gilgit -Baltistan the Government of Gilgit - Baltistan as well as the Federal Government is paying a

============================================================
PAGE 8
============================================================

8 deaf ear and administration of justice is not possible with an incomplete court. 7. 

That the majority members of the Bar Association are of the firmed vi ew that in the existing circumstances we are not in a position to get justice our valuable clients and we deem it improper to plead the cases before a Court which is incomplete as per mandate of Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance), Order, 2009. 8. 

That, it is the primary duty of being an advocate as well as of the Bar to strive for the rule of law and dispensation of justice in its true letter and spirit as is said that, “Justice should not only be done but is should also seem to have been done”. 9. 

That, the strike in question was against the Government of Gilgit -Baltistan as well as the Federal Government. 10. 

That, the situation as of today has altogether changed and the strike has been recalled and has been limited to one day (Monday) in a week. 11. 

That the lawyers community has announced strike against the lethargic and adamant attitude of the Government of Gilgit -Baltistan as well as the Federal Government. 

In view of the above, it is, respectfully prayed that the instant show cause notice be disposed off in view of the changed scenario to meet the ends of justice and equity.

The case was taken up on 23.04.2018 in Chamber for hearing. 

The respondents stated that t hey do not want to add more as a comprehensive reply of the Show Cause Notices have already been submitted. 

Consequently, upon hearing the respondents, the order was reserved. 6. 

In their joint reply the respondents contended that they have called a lawful strike and decided to boycott the proceedings of this Court as such the advocates of this Court did not appear w.e.f. 05.10.2017 to 28.02.2018 in the Court’s proceedings. 

According to them, the Court was incomplete and in such circumstance s their clients could not get justice. 

They felt it proper not to appear and plead their clients cases in this Court accordingly. 

They also stated in their reply that the strike in question was legal & against the attitude of the Government of Gilgit -Baltistan and the Federal Government for not appointing the 3rd judge of this Court and the judges of the learned Chief Court. 

They further stated in the said reply that the collective decision of the Bar was neither instigating nor provoking the lawyers of thi s Court. 7. 

I have heard the respondents, gone through their reply of the Show Cause Notices submitted by the respondents jointly and the reply of Mr. 

Muhammad Hussain Shehzad Advocate (respondent) filed individually. 

I have also perused Rule ( 06) & (07) of Order IV of The Supreme Appellate Court Rules, 2008.

The respondents have admitted that they had decided not to appear in this Court as they were not expecting to get justice for the ir valuable clients. 

They deemed it improper to plead them before a Court which is incomplete as per The Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009. 

Admittedly, they did not appear in this Court to proceed with the case(s) of their Clients for a couple of months i.e. with ef fect from 5th October 2017 to 28th February, 2018. 

The respondents willfully attempted to make this Court non -functional for ulterior motives. 

The respondents provoked and instigated the other lawyers of this Court for their non -appearance in the Court. 

Prima facie, the respondent ’s conduct was of unbecoming of advocate s. 

The respondents have attempted to interfere in the internal affairs of this Court as well who created hurdles and tried to frustrate the proceedings of this Court due to their non-appearance to conduct cases fixed in Court. 

The poor litigants were constrained either to plead their cases themselves and /or to engage other lawyers in circumstances. 

Muhammad Abbas Khan Advocate, Mr. 

Shakoor Khan Advocate and Malik Kafayat -ur-Rehman Advocate and others lawyers were, however, appearing in this Court without fail. 

It is also to be noted that all the lawyers of this Court including the respondents were appearing after the sudden death of Mr.
