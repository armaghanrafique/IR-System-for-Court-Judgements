The said convict being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment of the learned Trial Court filed Criminal Appeal No. 32/2010 in the learned Chief Court. 

Upon hearing, the learned Chief Court accepted the said appeal of the respondents and acquitted them from all charges.

5 respondents/ accused. 

They further submit that statements of accused namely Nawab Khan and Mst. 

Jahan Begum have been voluntarily recorded under Section 164 Cr. 

PC by the learned Judicial Magistrate. 

They have narrated the true story of the occurrence and admitted this guilt. 

The Postmortem of dead body of the deceased was conducted. 

The medico -legal report also supports the prosecution’s version. 

They submit that all PWs are natural witnesses and despite of lengthy cross examina tion by the defence counsel, their testimonies could not be shattered. 

The prosecution has successfully proved its case against the respondents beyond any shadow of doubt. 

The learned Trial Court has rightly convicted both the respondents/ accused and sentenced them in accordance with law which was subsequently set aside by the learned Chief Court by acquitting the accused. 

They submit that the learned Chief Court fell in error and misread the material evidence on record while passing the impugned judgment. 

They pray that the impugned judgment be set aside and judgment of the learned Trial Court be maintained. 7. 

On the other hand, the lear ned counsel for the respondent No. 02 (namely Nawab Khan ) supports the impugned judgment dated 15.05.2 013 in Criminal Appeal No. 32/2010, passed by the learned Chief Court. 

He contends that co-accused Nawab Khan has not been nominated in the FIR. 

Neither prosecution witnesses have attributed any role to respondent Nawab Khan nor any other material on record available to connect

6 him in the commission of the alleged offence. 

He was juvenile at the time of the occurrence and admittedly no separate trial has been conducted under the Juvenile Law which is against the principle of criminal justice system. 

Pe r learned counsel, the learned Trial Court has wrongly convicted/sentenced the respondent No. 02 which has rightly been acquitted by the learned Chief Court. 

He contends that the impugned judgment is well reasoned and well founded and no interference is wa rranted into it. 8. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, appraised the prosecution evidence, perused the material on record of the case file and gone through the impugned judgment as well as judgment passed by the learn ed Trial Court. 

The perusal of the materials available on record proves that the deceased was murdered by the respondents & wife of the deceased in pre -planned manners. 

The confessions of the both respondents recorded under Section 164 Cr. 

PC are incul patory in nature. 

The respondents were attributed specific role in the commission of the murder of deceased (Sher Alam). 

The dead body of the deceased and the crime weapon i.e. stone and an axe, were recovered on the pointation of the respondents/ accused which is admissible in evidence as provided under Article 40 of the Qanoon -e-Shahadat order 1984. 

The prosecution evidence produced in court is inspiring confidence. 

In our considered view, the prosecution has successfully proved its case against the respon dents beyond any shadow of doubt. 

Admittedly, the respondent No. 02 namely Nawab

============================================================

============================================================

7 Khan son of Mir Ghazi resident of Kargah Gilgit was minor/juvenile at the time of the commission of the murder of the deceased. 

No separate trial of the respondent was carried out in line with the Juvenile Law who has already suffered agony of protracted trial with the criminals. 9. 

In view of the above discussions, this appeal was allowed to the extent of respondent No. 01 namely Sakhawat Dar son of Dilawar Khan resident of Tangir, District Diamer vide our short order dated 03.07.201 7. 

Consequently, the conviction and sentence (s) awarded by the learned Trial Court vide judgment dated 15.12.2010 in Session Case No. 57/2009 to respondent Sakhawat Dar was maintained, however, the death sentence awarded to him was withheld and the same was converted into life imprisonment. 

The impugned judgment dated 15.05.2013 in Criminal Appeal No. 32/2010 passed by the learned Chief Court was set aside to the extent of respondent Sa khawat Dar. 

As regards, respondent No. 02 i.e. 

Nawab Khan son of Mir Ghazi was admittedly juvenile at the time of occurrence. 

Since, no trial was separately conducted against him under the juvenile law, therefore, his acquittal order vide impugned judgment dated 15.05.2013 in Criminal Appeal No. 29/2012 passed by the learned Chief Court was maintained by our said short order dated 03.07.2017. 10. 

The copy of this order be sent to the learned Trial Court forthwith for compliance in accordance with law. 

In case, convict Sakhawat Dar son of Dilawar Khan, resident of Tangir, District

In case the said convict does not surrender then the learned Trial Court may adopt all measures for his arrest in order to serve sentence in accordance with law. 

These were the reasons of our short order dated 03.07.2017. 11. 

The appeal is disposed off i n above terms.
