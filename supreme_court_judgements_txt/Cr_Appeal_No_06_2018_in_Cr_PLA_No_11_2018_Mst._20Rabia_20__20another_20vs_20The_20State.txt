We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned order passed by the learned Chief Court. 

The petitioner Mst. 

Rabia has stated in this court as well as before the local Magistrate and in the learned Chief Court that nobody has abducted her. 

She contracted marriage with Sanaullah with her consent and free will. 

To continue Criminal proceedings against the petitioners after above statement of Mst. 

Rabia would be an abuse to the process of Court. 

The impugned order passed by the learned Chief Court is not tenable in law being not well reasoned and well founded. 6. 

In view of the above discussions, this petition is converted into an appeal and the same is allowed. 

Consequently, the impugned order dated 14.12.2017 in Cr. 

Misc. 

No. 193/2017 passed by the learned Chief Court is set aside. 

The FIR No. 29/2017 under Section 363, 365 -B/109/34 PPC registered at Police Station Thore, District Diamer and/or proceedings, if any, pending in the learned Trial Court arise n out of said FIR are hereby quashed. 7.
