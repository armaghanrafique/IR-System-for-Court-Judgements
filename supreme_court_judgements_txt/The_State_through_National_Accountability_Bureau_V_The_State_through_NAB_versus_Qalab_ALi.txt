2 respondents, the operation of the impugned judgment, however, was suspended on 06.10.2015 and the case was finally heard on 24.11.2016 and the judgment was reserved. 2. 

Briefly facts of the case are that the National Accountability Bureau initiated an investigation against the respondents on the written complain t made by the Head Office Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan at Karachi vide letter No. 

IDBP/GF -167/3014 dated 04.01.2003 addressed to the Director Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Economic Crime Wing, at Islamabad. 

The gist of the letter was that Mr. 

Qalab Ali, respondent No. 01 obtained loan fraudulently up to Rs. 5.702 million from the Gilgit Branch of the petitioner Bank without providing proper securi ties. 

The Branch Manager respondent No. 02 sanctioned the said loan without obtaining sanction from the competent authority as such the respondent No. 01 has committed fraud, causing loss and damages to the Bank in connivance with petitioner No. 02. 

The respondents were liable to be taken criminal action by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and prayed for registration of the case against the respondents. 

The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) later on transferred the case to the National Accountability Bureau to probe into the matter as per law. 

The respondents were arrested by the National Accountability Bureau authorities with the assistance of the local police on 21.07.2010. 

Whereafter transit remand was obtained from the Accountability Court Gilgit to take the respondents to Rawalpindi. 

The respondents being aggrieved

============================================================

============================================================

3 challenged the said transit remand before the learned Gilgit - Baltistan Chief Court. 

Upon hearing the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court suspended the said transit remand. 

Consequently, the respondents were kept in Gilgit jail under interim judicial remand granted by the learned Accountability Court Gilgit. 

The respondents feeling aggrieved filed Writ Petition No. 47/2010, Criminal Petition No. 11/2010 and Criminal Miscellaneous No. 62/ 2010 before the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court which upon hearing were allowed vide common impugned judgment dated 09.08.2010. 3. 

The learned Additional Prosecutor General National Accountability Bureau (NAB) submits that the Head Office, Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan at Karachi vide letter No. 

IDBP/GF -167/3014 dated 04.01.2003 addressed to the Director Federal Investigation Agency Economic Crime Wing Islamabad for registration of case against accused Qalb -e-Ali, the then Chairma n, District Council, Gilgit and Mera Jan, the then Manager, Branch Office Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP ), Gilgit on the allegations of causing loss and damages to Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP ) by way of obtaining /disbursin g loan fraudulently & committing offence of corruption and corrupt practices. 4. 

He also submits that on transfer of case from Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to National Accountability Bureau, the case record revealed that alleged accuse d Qalb-e-Ali, while he was Chairman of District Council Gilgit, by misusing of his authority

============================================================
PAGE 4
============================================================

4 and fraudulently submitted funds of District Council Gilgit as security against his personal loan and accused Mera Jan, the then Branch Manager, Industrial Developm ent Bank of Pakistan ( IDBP ), Gilgit sanctioned the loan beyond his financial powers. 

He submits that the accused Mera Jan also received Rs. 300,000/ - vide cheque No. 721028 dated 22.12.2001, out of said loan account as an illegal gratification. 

He submits that the accused were found involved in connivance with each other in committing the crime of scheduled offence of misuse of authority, corruption and corrupt practices. 

He submits that the inquiry was initiated against the accused by the National Accounta bility Bureau at Rawalpindi vide authorization letter No. 06/2003/FIA/T -8/A-II/IW/NAB/Rwp/2007 dated 24.08.2007. 

No reference from Governor State Bank of Pakistan was required in the offence of corruption and corrupt practices as defined in scheduled offences under Section 9(a) of The National Accountability Bureau Ordina nce, 1999. 5. 

As per the learned Additional Prosecutor General National Accountability Bureau (NAB) that later on Investigation Officer (I.O) of the case was changed and case was transferred to National Accountability Bureau, sub -office at Gilgit. 

Due to shortage of Investigating Officer s in the sub -office at Gilgit, consequently, the case was remitted for investigation t o National Accountability Bureau at Rawalpindi. 

He submits that during the inquiry, accused Qalb-e-Ali appeared at National Accountability Bureau Rawalpindi on 26.06.2009 whereby Qalb -e-Ali

============================================================
PAGE 5
============================================================

5 respondent/ accused made request for Voluntary Return of Rs. 5,702,325/ - by accepting his guilt that loan was taken by him in his personal capacity. 

Subsequently o n 01.07.2008, accused Qalb - e-Ali submitted an affidavit for Voluntary Return of the alleged liability in installments. 

He further submits that the accused Qalb - e-Ali submitted request on 27.07.2009 for prov ision of time to arrange security/guarantee and payment of liability. 

He submits that after his Voluntary Return application he was repeatedly summoned but he did not turn up. 

He, however, sent applications dated 28.08.2009 & 14.10.2009 praying therein for extension in payment of the said amount. 6. 

He contends that the case against the respondents was that the loan sanctioned fraudulently in favour of the respondent No. 01 by the respondent No. 02 falls within the provisions of corruption and corrupt practices. 

The inquiry/investigation initiated against the respondents by the National Accountability Bureau was absolutely fa lls within the scope of Section 9 of the National Accountability Bureau Ordinance 1999 and scheduled offences thereto. 

He also con tends that the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court fell in error and mis -conceiv ably observed and held that the loan taken by the respondent No. 01 was “imprudent loan” and inquiry/investigation initiated by the National Accountability Bureau was illegal and without jurisdiction. 

He further contends that the inquiry was not initiated on the basis that the loan was defaulted or imprudent. 

On the contrary the loan obtained by the

============================================================
PAGE 6
============================================================

6 respondent No. 01 and sanctioned by the respondent No. 02 was taken fraudulentl y in collusion with each other, which amounts to the misuse of authority and corrupt practices, hence, the inquiry/investigation conducted by the National Accountability Bureau was legal and in accordance with law. 

He contends that the respondent No. 01 na mely Qalb -e-Ali submitted a fake minutes of the meeting of the District Council Gilgit (DCG) and other documents in the name of District Council Gilgit whereas the respondent No. 02 namely Mera Jan sanctioned the unauthorized loan by receiving bribe. 

The r espondent No. 03 namely Mumtaz Khan the then Chief Officer/Drawing & Disbursing Officer District Council Gilgit by misusing of his authority and corrupt practices in connivance with each others sustained loss to the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan. 

He also contends that the respondents also misappropriated the funds of District Council Gilgit by opening another bank account malafidely in connivance with each other. 

He submits that the sufficient materials available on record which connect the respon dents with the commission of fraudulently obtaining loan, misusing of their authorities and committing an offence of corruption & corrupt practices, hence, the impugned common judgment dated 09.08.2010 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court is not sustainable. 

While saying so he relied upon the case law of this court announced on 30.05.2016 titled Muhammad Arif & 05 others versus National Bank of Pakistan & 06 others.

7 7. 

On the other hand, the learned couns els for the respondents contend that respondent No. 01 was the then Chairman District Council Gilgit (DCG), respondent No. 02 was the then Manager Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan at Gilgit whereas the respondent No. 03 was the then Drawing & Disbursing Officer, District Council Gilgit. 

They also contend that the respondent No. 01 applied for loan from the respondent No. 02 who accordingly sanctioned the said loan in favour of the respondent No. 01 as per Banking rule and procedure. 

They also submit that it was not a case of illegal and “Imprudent Loan” rather the same was a legal and “Prudent Loan”. 

They contend that recover y suit was later on filed by the petitioner’s Bank which was decreed by the competent court of law declaring the same as rightly sanctioned and “Prudent Loan”. 

They further contend that the petitioner had no authority to investigate and arrest the respondents as the alleged offence does not fall under their jurisdiction. 

They further contend that the mandatory procedural pre -condition under Section 31(d) of (the National Accountability ) Ordinance 1999, has not been adopted and according to which reference by Governor State Bank of Pakistan is mandatory to obtain approval for prosecution from Governor State Bank of Pakistan which has yet not been obtained by the petitioner who unauthorizedly and illegally made request to the National Accountability Bureau Authorities to take the respondents for inquiry which is unlawful

============================================================
PAGE 8
============================================================

8 and illegal as per provision of the National Accountability Bureau Ordin ance, 1999. 8. 

The learned counsel s for the respondents also contend that a Civil Suit filed by the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan on the same subject was decreed which preclude the National Accountability Bureau to entertain the complaint of Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan and to investigate or conduct inquiry against the respondents. 

They also contend that it is a case of double jeopardy as no one can be vexed twice for the same offence. 

The respondent No. 02 has already been prosecuted by the departmental authorities under E&D Rules. 

Consequently he was terminated from his services as Manager Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan whereas the respondent No. 01 has submitted Voluntary Return to pay the said loan which he availed from the said Bank. 

They also contend that the impugned judgment dated 09.08.2010 in Writ Petition No. 47/2010, Criminal Rev. 

No. 11/2010 and Criminal Misc. 

No. 62/2010 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court may pleased be maintained being well reasoned by restraining the petitioner to conduct inquiries/investigations against the respondents as sanction /approval has not been obtained from the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan. 

While saying so they support their contentions by relying upon the case laws reported as (PLD 2001 Karachi 311) and (PLD 2013, Sindh 357).

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned common judgment dated 09.08.2010 passed in Writ Petition No. 47/2010 in Criminal Rev. 

Petition No. 11/2010 and Criminal Misc. 

No. 62/2010 by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court. 

We have also gone through the grounds taken by the respondents in their Writ Pet ition No. 47/2010, Criminal Revi sion No. 11/2010 and Criminal Misc. 

No. 62/2010. 

No where the plea has been taken by the respondents regarding the prudent, imprudent or defaulted loan. 

They have challenged only the jurisdiction of National Accountability Bureau authorities in the region of Gilgit -Baltistan. 

As per said averments, the National Accountability Bureau arrested the respondents illegally, without lawful authority and against the provisions of The Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009. 

Further the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan has also filed a suit for recovery of Rs. 78, 96,500/ - against the respondents and the District Council Gilgit in the learned Banking Court. 

The learned Chief Court mis-conceivably held that the case in hand admittedly relates to the bank loan either imprudent or willful default. 

It is further held that to initiate inquiry / investigation in such cases, the permission of the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan is mandatory. 

On the contrary the cas e of the respondents was/is for obtaining fraudulent loan by misusing of authority and committing the offence of corruption and corrupt practices by the respondents. 

The

============================================================
PAGE 10
============================================================

10 case law relied upon by the learned Additional Prosecutor General National Accountabil ity Bureau is applicable whereas the case laws cited by the learned counsels for the respondents are distinguishable. 10. 

We, in order to ascertai n accusation of the respondents & jurisdiction of National Accountability Bureau authorities in this region, have gone through the provisions of Sections 9, 18, 19 and 25 of The National Accountability Bureau Ordinance, 1999 which are reproduced as under: - “SECTION 9.

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 15 or any other law for the time being in force, where a holder of public office or any other person, prior to the authorization of investigation against him, voluntarily comes forward and offers to return the assets or gains acquired or made by him in the course, or as the consequence, of any offence under this Ordinance, the Chairma n NAB may accept such offer and after determination of the amount due from such person and its deposit with the NAB discharge such person from all his liability in respect of the matter or transaction in issue.

============================================================

15 (c) the amount deposited by the accused with the NAB shall be transferred to the Federal Government or, as the case may be, a Provincial Government or the concerned bank or financial institution, company, body corporate, co -operative society, statutory body, or authority concerned within one month from the date of such deposit. ” 11. 

The plain reading of the aforementioned provisions of law and in presence of the admission of the respondent No. 0 1, on receipt of Cheque amounting to Rs. 300,000/ - by the respondent No.02 as an illegal gratification & the termination of the services of the respondent No.03, the inquiry/investigation initiated by the National Accountability Bureau authorities was within their jurisdiction and they have legally taken the cognizance of it. 

The National Accountability Bureau authorities cannot be precluded or restrained to conduct an inquiry/investigation under The National Accountability Bureau Ordinance 1999. 

The mere filing of the Civil Suit by the Indu strial Development Bank of Pakistan for recovery of loan against the respondents does not preclude or restrain the National Accountability Bureau for initiation of inquir y /investigati on against the respondents who allegedly obtained loan fraudulently, mis -used of their authorities and committed offences of Corruption & Corrupt practices. 

In our considered view, the provisions of Article 13 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan or Section 26 of The General Clauses Act and /or Section 403 of Th e Criminal Procedure Code do not attract.

============================================================
PAGE 16
============================================================

16 12. 

Further the plain reading of Sub Section (e) of Section 18 of the Ordinance insists that for purpose of an inquiry or investigation, the officer so inquiring /investigating shall have all the powers as are available with officer –in-charge of a police station under the code, which are so provided under Chapter XIV of the Criminal Procedure Code. 

Needless to add here that Chapter XIV of the Cr. 

PC also includes the Section 160 to 1 64 Cr.PC which deal with po wer to require attendance, recording of statement. 

Since from the bare reading of Section 18(b) of the Ordinance it becomes clear that an inquiry /investigation could be initiated only by the Chairman or an officer of the NAB, duly authorized by him, thus the officer, so authorized for conducting such an inquiry /investigation, shall enjoy all powers as are available to an officer -in-Charge of a police Station within meaning of the Chapter XIV of the Criminal Procedure Code. 

Whereas the bare reading of the provisions of Section 19 of The National Accountability Bureau, Ordinance 1999 reveals that if an inquiry or investigation is ordered in respect of offence punishable under the Ordinance by Chairman NAB then during the course of the said inquiry or investi gation of such offence any officer duly authorized by Chairman is competent to call for information from any person for the purpose of Satisfying himself whether there has been any contravention of the provisions of the Ordinance or any rule or order made thereunder. 

Thus it is manifest that it empowers the authorized officer to examine any person acquainted with the facts and circumstance of the case.

============================================================
PAGE 17
============================================================

17 “Any Person” includes witnesses or an accused even. 

We are in complete agreement and acknowledge the legal position that one cannot be compelled to answer a question which can expose him to criminal charges and that one cannot be forced to be a witness which is so evident from the section 161 of the Code and Article 13 (2) of the Constitution. 13. 

In view o f the above discussions, we hold that the National Accountability Bureau authorities were/are lawfully authorized to conduct inquiry / investigation and interfere nce into its authorities would seriously prejudice to the prosecution towards its right in prob ing into an investigation /inquiry of an offence. 

Consequent thereto, we convert this petition into an appeal and the same is allowed.
