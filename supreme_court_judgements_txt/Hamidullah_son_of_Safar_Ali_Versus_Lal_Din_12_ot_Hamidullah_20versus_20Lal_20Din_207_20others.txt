2 no right to make a pedestrian passage through the land of the petitioner by using the same as his animal track during spring seasons. 

Per the averments of the petitioner, the respondents have an alternate way for their pasture. 

The respondents denied all the averment of the plaint contending therein that the passage in question is used by them s ince last 20 years to take their animals to the pasture. 

The learned Trial Court upon hearing dismissed the Civil Suit of the petitioner being meritless vide judgment dated 30.05.2008 which was upheld up to the learned Chief Court. 3. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that although there are concurrent findings of the learned three Courts below in favour of the respondents yet the all Courts below fell in error while passing the impugned judgments/orders. 

He submits that th e respondents have an alternate way/passage to their pasture provided by one Sharif. 

Per learned counsel, the local respondents interfering into the land of the petitioner by claiming the same as their passage. 

He further submits that the respondents failed to prove their claim through documentary as well as oral evidence that the said passage has been used by them for last 20 years. 

On the directives of the learned Trial Court an inquiry committee was constituted consisting of the Revenue Officials. 

The committee reported that no path is available on the site as no Sketch Cloth and Masavi is found in the Revenue Record. 

Per learned counsel, it has been also reported in the inquiry that an alternate passage of 03 to 04 feet is existed at the site for the

3 animal track/passage for the respondents. 

During the trial of the case in the learned Chief Court it was also directed to inquire into the matter by the learned Assistant Com missioner Astore wherein he again narrated the previous report. 

The learne d Chief Court instead of said two reports has wrongly dismissed the Civil Revision of the petitioner vide impugned judgment dated 06.09.2016 by maintaining the concurrent findings of the Courts below. 

He submits that the impugned judgment is not sustainable and li able to be set aside. 4. 

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondents supports the impugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court. 

He contends that the disputed passage is the traditional way of the respondents which has been used for l ast 40 years and the petitioner is wrongly trying to interfere into it. 

He also contends that the petitioner failed to produce any oral as well as documentary evidence in support of his claim whereas the respondents proved their contentions through credibl e evidence. 

Per learned counsel, the learned courts below have rightly dismissed the suit of the petitioner being meritless, hence, the same are required to be maintained. 

He prays that the impugned judgment may pleased be affirmed. 5. 

We have heard the l earned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record of the case and gone through the impugned judgment as well as the concurrent findings of the learned Courts below. 

In our considered view, the
