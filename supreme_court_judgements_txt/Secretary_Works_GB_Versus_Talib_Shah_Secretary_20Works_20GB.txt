Dr. 

Rana Muhammad Shamim, CJ……… This petition for leave to appeal has arisen out of the impugned judgment in Suo Moto case No. 02/2014, dated 28.05.2014, passed by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan whereby the application filed by respondents, has been accepted and the petitioners were directed to pay compensation to the respondents at the rate of Rs. 6,00,000/ per kanal with compulsory acquisition charges of 15% with 8% compound interest, in addition to pay the prices of the trees and damages of crops from 07.05.2012 till date of payment. 

The learned Advocate General Gilgit -Baltistan submits that the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 71 of “The Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009” was not supposed to enter into the realm of factual controversy and give any opinion/verdict thereto. 

He maintained that under no circumstances the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan could meddle with the affairs in which an adequate and efficacious remedy can be had from the Court below. 

He also submits that “Article 71 of The Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009”, does not provide to the Chief Court to exercise of Suo Motu jurisdiction and an order passed in exercise of such jurisdiction shall be corrum -non-judice.

3 On the other hand, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents supports the impugned Judgment and argued that the learned Chief Court on getting information about infringement of any fundamental right was well within its rights to step in and pass an appropriate order. 

He contends that where fundamentals rights of the citizens are trampled over, the Chief Court can exercise of its Suo Motu Jurisdiction. 

He finally submits that the learned Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan has rightly taken cognizance of the matter and passed an appropriate order redressing the grievances of the persons aggrieved. 

We have hea rd the learned Counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the materials placed on record and gone through the impugned Judgment. 

The question arises as to whether Article 71 of The Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009 re ad with Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, expressly or by implication, provides for exercise of Suo Motu Jurisdiction by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan. 

We have been fortified by the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakis tan in a case of Dr. 

Imran Khattak and others versus Ms. 

Sofia Waqas Khattak & others, reported as 2014, SCMR, Page 122, and we followed the parameters laid down therein. 

For convenience we hereby reproduced both the articles i.e. 

Article 71 of “The Gil git-Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009”, and “Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973” as under: -

7 the Court, for reasons to be recorde d in writing, is satisfied that the interim order --- (i) Would not have such effect as aforesaid; or (ii) Would have the effect of suspending an order or proceeding which on the face of the record is without jurisdiction. (4A) An interim order made by a H igh Court on an application made to it to question the validity or legal effe4ct of any order made, proceeding taken or act done by any authority or person, which has been made, taken or done or purports to have been made, taken or done under any law which is specified in part 1 of the First Schedule or relates to, or is connected with, State property or assessment or collection of public revenues shall cease to have effect on the expiration of a period of six months following the day on which it is made: Provided that the matter shall be finally decided by the High Court within six months from the date on which the interim order is made.

8 A careful perusal of both the articles reproduced above would show that the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan & High Courts of Pakistan would exercise its extr aordinary discretionary constitutional Jurisdiction where it is satisfied that, subject to the constitution, no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of a person whether aggrieved or not on an information or on its own knowledge. 

In view of the above discussion in our considered view the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan cannot exercise Suo Motu Jurisdiction under Article 71 of Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self -Governance) Order, 2009. 

Consequently, we converted this petition into an appeal and the same was allowed vide our short order dated 29.10.2015. 

The respondents, if, aggrieved may approach the proper forum /Court Of Law for redressal of their grievances. 

These were the reasons of our short order. 

The appeal is allowed.
