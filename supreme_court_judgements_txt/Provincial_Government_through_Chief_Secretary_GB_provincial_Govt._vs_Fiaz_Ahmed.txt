he got first position as per merit list. 

Subsequently, 02 more posts of Assistant Civil Supply Inspector BPS -05 were created/sanctioned. 

The respondent No. 2 Abdul Jahan was selected against one of the said posts. 

He further submits that the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan by following an out dated analogy of selection allowed the petition filed by the respondent No. 01 vide Writ Petition No. 90/2012 on 25.03.20 14 and directed the appellants to appoint him for the post applied for as he got 2nd position in the merit list. 

While accepting the petition and passing the following order setting the things correct: - (A). 

Respondents No. 1 to 4 are directed to issue/pas s office order appointing petitioner with effect from 1st September 2012 ( 01.09.2012) against the posts of ACSI BPS-05 in the department of respondents No. 1 to 4. (B).

Baltistan based on misconception and on an out dated analogy of selection and the same is liable to set aside. 

On t he other hand, Mr. 

Amjad Hussain the learned counsel for the petitioners submits that since two posts of Assistant Civil Supply Inspector (BPS - 05) were not admittedly advertised in the newspapers and against one o those posts one Abdul Jahan s/o Abdul Qay oom has been selected/ appointed by the appellants secretly as he got 3rd position in the test/interview, whereas, the respondent No. 1 Fiaz Ahmed s/o Abdullah Khan was ignored inspite of the fact that he got 2nd position in the test/interview as per merit list. 

He was ignored by the appellants for the best reason known to them, which is contrary to the fundamental rights guaranteed under article -71(2) of Gilgit -Baltistan (Self Empowerment & Governance) Order, 2009 as well as the enabling articles of the con stitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. 

He further contended that the respondent No. 1 has preferential right over the respondent No. 2 for the appointment for one of the said two vacant posts as per final merit list, which is against principle of natur al justice and equity. 

He further submits that the learned Advocate General Gilgit -Baltistan appearing on behalf of the petitioner could not find out any infirmity and illegality in the impugned judgment dated 25.03.2014 in Writ Petition No. 19/2012 passed by the learned Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan and prayed that the same be maintained in its letters and spirits. 

We heard the learned counsel for the parties, perused that material on record and agree with the contention raised by Mr. 

Amjad Hussain learne d advocate for the respondent. 

The petition is converted into an appeal and partially allowed with the modification that the respondent No. 1 be appointed as Assistant Civil Supply Inspector (BPS -05) with prospective effect i.e. from the date of issuance of his appointment letter by the office of respondent No. 02 thereto.
