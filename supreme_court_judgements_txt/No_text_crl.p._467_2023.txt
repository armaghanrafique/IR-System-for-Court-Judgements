In deliberation to falsely implicate the petitioner. 

As far as the delay^ autopsy of deceased is concerned, the perusal of the postmortem report (Exh.PAC) showsoverpower the petitioner during which one of them was seriously injured but it is natural that after reaching the place of occurrence the complainant (PW-8) being the real father of the victim required some time and extra ordinaryarea of Islamabad, the police was required to be extra nerves to absorb the extreme shock of his life and thencome forward. 

It is the prosecution version that theLatif (PW-2) had reached the place of occurrence at 10.00 p.m. and Basharat Rehman (PW-3) reached the place of occurrence at 9.30 p.m. after when he received a call at

Sara Ali Hashmi (PW-16) this court in Muhammad Rafiq ’s caseh The death was found unnatural. 

This delay of conducting postmortem of about 12 hours is not fatal as the autopsy is to be conducted after when the inquest report and injury also mindful of the fact the FIR.

Meanwhile, the petitioner jumped and landed on the floor of the porch and snatched the mobile phone of deceased, locked her in the outer cabin along with the main gate of the house meant as guard room. 

He then opened the cabin and physically assaulted her whereas Muhammad Jan did not make any effort to stop the petitioner. 

She was then dragged back into the house of the petitioner which was her last glimpse in the CCTV footages. 

The unseen occurrence the eye of camera and the scene was recorded. 

It was not mere seeing the petitioner with the deceased before the unnatural death caused in most brutal manner, but there with crime as held in Muhammad Abid ’s case. 2 Besides, the said snatched mobile phone by the petitioner had been (Exh.PBE).

In my view as well the no mitigating circumstances 9. existed in the present case, the minor discrepancies in the time of occurrence, the delay in postmortem, absence of the finger prints on the knife but matched with the DNA of the petitioner, minor delay in lodging the FIR would not affect the credibility of the prosecution evidence which had circumstantial evidence, one end of the rope is found tied with the dead body of Noor Muqaddam and the other end tied with the neck of the petitioner. of a vice spreading in the upper society which we know asproved the guilt of the petitioner beyond any reasonable doubt to award a capital punishment.
