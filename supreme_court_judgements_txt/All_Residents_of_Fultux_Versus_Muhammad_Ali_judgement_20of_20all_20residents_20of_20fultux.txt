JUDGMENT RAJA JALAL -UD-DIN, J..... 

The plaintiffs/respondents filed a civil suit for recovery of Rupees Four Lac Fifty Three Thousand and Three Hundred Seventy Seven only (Rs. 4,53,377 /-) payable to them on the basis of an agreement between the par ties through arbitrators dated 10/3/2008, in the Trial Court. 

The petitioners/defendants file d an application under Order 7 Rule 11 C.P.C with the plea that Section 32 of the Arbitration Act bars the enforcing of an arbitration agreement through a civil suit. 

The miscellaneous appl ication was turned down by the T rial Court. 

The Chief C ourt Gilgit -Baltistan also concur red with the findings of the T rial Court and dismissed the revision petition preferred. 

The Trial Court was ordered to proceed with the trial. 

The petitioners basically pleads that the Civil Suit preferred is based on an agreement reached between the parties through an arbitration, hence it being an award cannot be challenged through a Civil Suit, hence liable to be rejected, reliance is placed on 1988 SCMR, 1146. 

On the other hand counsel for the plaintiff s is of the view that the suit itself is not based on the award of any court but it is an agreement reached between the parties through arbitrators and in the strict sense it cannot b e termed as defined under section 32 of the Arbitration Act 1940. 

We have heard the partie s and conclude as under, An award in the strict sense under Arbitration Act has to go through legal formalities such as, the reference of a subject matter through arbitration on consent of the parties. 

The award passed has to go through the objections filed by the parties and eventually can be made rule of the court. 

In the instant case it is a matter which has been settled outside the court with the consent of the parties. 

In the present case the arbitrators appointed by the consent of both the parties and documents signed cannot be enforced by termed

3 as an award which bars a civil suit as defined in section 32 of Arbitration Act. 

It is simply a piece of evidence in a civil suit. 

We therefore are of the considered view that the Civil Suit is not barred under the Arbitration Act and the miscellaneous application of the respondents under Order 7 Rule 11 C.P.C has rightly been dism issed by the Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan. 

The petition being meritless is dismissed and the Trial Court to proceed where it has left off. 

Announced: - 01-10-2015.
