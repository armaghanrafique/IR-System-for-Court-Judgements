2 infavour of respondent in a case registered Under Section 447,147, 427,354,336, 337 -A PPC, with Police Station Yasin vide FIR bearing No. 9/2009 dated 8/5/2009. 2. 

The brief facts leading to the present petition are that the respondent and his other co -accused allegedly attacked one Gullo his daughter Mst.

It is also narrated in the FIR that the respondent and his party also filed a similar application in the same police station for making an attack o n them by the present complainant party.

3 application in the Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan which came to be heard by Mr. 

Sahib Khan, the learned J udge Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan who, vide impugned order granted bail to the respondent holding that the case being one of further inquiry within the meaning of 497 (2) Cr.P.C, the respondent is entitled for grant of bail. 5. 

The above order has been challenged by the state through learned Advocate General with prayer for re -calling /cancellation of bail granted to the present respondent. 6. 

We have heard the learned counsel for the parties, the learned Advo cate General seeks cancellation of bail on the ground that a prima facie case existed against the respondent, he was specifically named in the FIR with a specific motive for causing injuries to Mst. 

Nas eema and gullo but the learned Chief Court in disregar d of principles for grant and refusal of the bail has enlarged the respondent on bail. 

He contended that the act of the respondent was brutal in nature, he even did not spare a teenage girl who had come to rescue her father, sustained severe head injuries, remained in hospital for a period of six months and lost her senses and jumped into the river. 

He said the other victim of the occurrence “gullo ” had also received grievous injurious as per Medical report. 

T he learned Advocate General lastly contended tha t a specific and overt act had been attributed to the respondent in the statement s recorded Under Section

4 161Cr.P.C. beside recovery of crime article on his pointation. 7. on the other hand the learned counsel for the respondent while vehemently supp orting the impugned order went on saying that the case against the respondent was one of further inquiry within the meaning of 497 (2) Cr.P.C. 

The offence did not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C. the parties had filed cross complai nts against each other and it was yet to be determined as to who was aggressor, other co - accused ha d either been let off Under Section 169 Cr.P.C. o r released on bail as such cancellation of bail at this stage would be violative of law. 

At the end of the a rguments the learned counsel for respondent submitted that the prosecution has failed to submit challan of the case as provided Under Section 173 Cr.P.C as such the respondent otherwise was entitled for grant of bail and the learned Chief Court has rightly granted bail to the respondents. 8. 

Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through available recor d and impugned order, we have co me to the conclusion that four witnesses namely Shah Khan, Zohra, Zahid Gull and Abdul Khan, beside two injured persons categorically charge the respondent for causing injuries to Gullo and Mst. 

Nas eema, their statement s are supported by Medical evidence and recovery of crime articles on the pointation of the respondent. 

Moreover the respondent has acte d in a brutal and ruthless manner, one of the victim namely

5 Mst. 

Nas eema a teenage girl who was shifted to PIMS Islam abad in a critical condition, she remained hospitalized for period of six months and underwent series of operations even than could not be recovered, resultantly she lost her sense and jumped into river. 

According to Medical report her skull was fractured due to severe head injury. 

The offence committed by the respondent prima facie fall within the mischief of Section 336 and 337 (v) which p rovide maximum sentence of 10 and 14 years R.I. respectively which fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C. 

The learned Judge Chief Court has wrongly held that the respondent was entitled for grant of bail on the ground of further inquiry as under the circumstance, the case of respondent was not a case of further inquiry as contemplated Under Section 497(2) Cr.P.C. and as discussed above. 9. 

So far as no n submission of challan is concerned the learned Advocate General submitted that due to non availability of Medical report the challan could not be submitted in the Trial Court. 

We have found that the copy of challan is placed in the file, however we direct the I.O. of the case to submit the same within seven (7) days of this order if not su bmitted earlier. 

For what has been discussed above, this petition is converted into appeal and allowed, the impugned order is set aside and concession of bail granted to the respondent by Chief Court vide order dated 17 -08-2009 is re -called. 

However our above observations are

============================================================

6 tentative in nature and the Trial C ourt shall proceed with the case uninfluenced by this order and shall dispose of f the same within six months. 

The respondent will be at liberty to move fresh bail application in case the trial is no t completed within the above period.
