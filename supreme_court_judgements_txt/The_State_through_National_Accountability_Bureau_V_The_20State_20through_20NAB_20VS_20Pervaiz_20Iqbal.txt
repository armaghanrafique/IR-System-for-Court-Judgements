The petitioner being aggrieved filed appeal before the learned Chief Court who upon hearing dismissed vide its judgment/order dated 12.06.2012 hence, this petition for leave to appeal. 7. 

The learned Additional Prosecutor General NAB submits that the embezzleme nt and corruption of the respondent as General Manager was disclosed in 1995 in an “A udit Report ” conducted jointly by the then Assistant Director LB&RD and Assistant Director FIA. 

Subsequently the investig ation was entrusted to the then Deputy Director FIA Gilgit who also recorded statement of remaining PWs under Section 161 Cr. 

PC and prepared report under Section 173 Cr. 

PC. 

He submits that after closing of investigation, the then Deputy Director FIA Gilg it submitted reference against the respondent in the learned Trial Court under NAB Ordinance, 1999 through Chairman NAB. 

Per learned counsel, the prosecution has successfully proved its case against the respo ndent beyond a shadow of doubt. 

The prosecution witnesses have supported prosecution version. 

He further submits that the FIA is competent to conduct inquiry/investigation of the case. 

The respondent basically belonged to a poor family but after assumption of charge of the post of General Manager NATCL, he accumulated moveable and immoveable propert ies in the name his family by means of corruption and corrupt practices. 

He submits that the respondent has failed to prove his innocence under Section 14 of NAB Ordinance 1999. 

He reiterates that the responde nt has caused

5 loss of Rs. 17,36,02,579/ - to NATCL and Government exchequer by embezzlement and misappropriation for which his is liable to be punished under Section 10 NAB ordinance, 1999. 

He submits that the learned Trial Court i.e. 

National Accountabili ty Court has rightly convicted the respondent in accordance with law on the contrary sentences awarded to the respondent were wrongly modified by the learned Chief Court vide impugned order /judgment dated 12.06.2012. 

He prays that the impugned order may graciously be set aside by maintaining the judgment dated 25.10.2010 earlier passed by the learned Trial Court. 8. 

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent supports the impugned order dated 12.06.2012 order passed by the learned Chief Court as well as the judgment dated 20.10.2010 passed by the learned Accountability Court Gilgit. 

He contends that the case against the respondent is based on the complaint lodged by one Haji Abdul Hakeem, Ex -Vice Chairman and Directors of NATCL against Mr. 

Mehmood Khan the then Chief Secretary Northern Areas now Gilgit -Baltistan, alleging malpractices and embezzlement on his part. 

He also contends that there was no allegation against the present respondent in the said complaint. 

Per learned counsel, the co mplaint against the then Chief Secretary Gilgit -Baltistan was forwarded to FIA for investigation and the inquiry of the case was conducted by Mr. 

Hajat Mir the then Assistant Director FIA Crime Circle Gilgit. 

During inquiry/investigation, the said Investig ating Officer (IO) diverted the

6 investigation towards respondent with malafide intention. 

The IO has also held responsible the then Chief Secretary Gilgit -Baltistan, Mr. 

Naseer Ahmed the then Home Secretary Gilgit -Baltistan, Mr. 

Younus Khan, Ex -Section Of ficer KANA Division Islamabad and Mr. 

Hassan Mir the then Executive Engineer B&R Division NAPWD Gilgit. 

He contends that the other accused were neither arrested nor they have been discharged under Section 169 Cr.PC. 

Their names as an accused appeared in co lumn No. 03 of the challan. 

He further contends that the respondent was made scapegoat and the reference submitted in the learned Trial Court was in utter violation of provisions of NAB Ordinance, 1999. 

He adds that under NAB Ordinance 1999, FIA is not com petent to conduct inquiry/ investigation in NAB cases and the respondent can not be arrested without prior permission of Chairman NAB. 

The respondent was arrested by FIA without permission of competent authority as such reference against the respondent was not in accordance with law. 

He contends that the prosecution has relied upon audit report conducted in 1995 for the period of 1993 -94 of NATCL but subsequently audit of NATCL was also conducted by Chartered Accountant for the period from 1990 to 1999 wher eby no objectionable point was raised against the respondent namely Pervaiz Iqbal. 

In this regard, the entire inquiry and reference is silent and audit of the Chartered Accountant was not taken into consideration by Investigating Officer (I.O) during inves tigation of the case. 

He submits that the prosecution has failed to prove its

7 case against the accused/respondent beyond any reasonable doubt. 

The learned Chief Court has rightly dismissed the appeal of the petitioner while passing the impugned order dated 12.06.2012 in Criminal Appeal No. 28/2010. 

The learned counsel for the respondent submits that the said impugned judgment is well reasoned and well founded which may graciously be maintained. 9. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned order dated 12.06.2012 passed by the learned Chief Court as well as the judgment dated 20.10.2010 passed by the learned Accountability Court. 

The learned Prosecutor NAB could not point out any infirmity and illegality in the impugned order passed by the learned Chief Court. in our considered view the impugned order is well reasoned and well founded & interference into it by t his court is not warranted. 10. 

In view of the above discussions, this appeal was dismissed vide our short order dated 15.06.2017. 

Consequently, the impugned order dated 12.06.2012 in Criminal Appeal No. 28/2010 passed by the learned Chief Court was affi rmed. 

These were the reasons of said short order. 11. 

The appeal is dismissed in above terms.
