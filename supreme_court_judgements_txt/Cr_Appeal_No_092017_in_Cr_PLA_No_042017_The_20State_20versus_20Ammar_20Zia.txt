2 FIR No. 93/99. 

Since, t he Criminal Appeal No. 04/2015 was earlier heard by the Division Bench of the learned Chief Court wherein diversion findings were recorded by the learned Judges, therefore, the matter was placed before the Referee Judge who passed the impugned judgment dated 28.10.2016. 

The petitioner/State being aggrieved filed th is petition for leave to appeal whereas the complainant has also moved petition for setting aside the impugned judgment and for enhancement of the conviction/sentence awarded by the learned Trail Court i.e. from life imprisonment to capital punishment. 

Since, the matters are connected with each other and have been directed out of the same impugned judgment, therefore, both the appeals were disposed of through our short order dated 04.07.2017. 

This court vide order dated 03.03.02017 issued notice to the respondent with the direction to submit sol vent surety worth of Rs. 500,000/ - to the satisfaction of the learned Registrar of this court but neither the respondent appeared nor he furnished the said solvent surety. 2.

P.C. -sd- Additional Sessions Judge Gilgit. 4. 

The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed for trial; however, he did not produce any defence witness. 

The prosecution in order to prove its case against the accused produced and examined as many as ten (10) PWs. 

Some of the said PWs became hostile whereas the complainant has passed away without deposi ng before the learned Trial Court while another eye witness namely Abdul Salam has been assassinated before recording of his statement in the Trial court. 

The prosecution mainly relied on the statement of PW. 02 exhibited documents, Post Mortem Report and recovery of weapon of offence etc. 5. 

The learned Trial Court after appraising the evidence, hearing the learned counsels for the respective parties and upon proven guilty convicted/sentenced the accused to life imprisonment vide judgment dated 28.02.2015. 

The operative part of the said judgment is hereby reproduced as under: - Quote: - “With the above observations, I am of the firm view that the prosecution through evidence of eyewitness and corroborated by post -mortem report has successfully proved the charge against the accused Ammar Zia. 

Keeping in view the above referred solitary evidence awarding life imprisonment has been held better by superior courts. 

The accused Ammar Zia s/o Amin Zia r/o Old Polo Ground Tehsil & District Gilgit has

Announced.” 28-02-2015 Unquote: - 6. 

The petitioner/complainant being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment of the learned Trial Court filed Criminal Appeal No. 03/2015 in the learned Chief Court for enhancement of the sentence/conviction awarded by the learned Trial Court whereas the respondent/accused also filed Criminal Appeal No. 04/2015 for setting aside the judgment of the learned Trial Court. 

Both the appeals were heard and decided by the Division Bench of the learned Chief Court wherein divergent findings were recorded by the learned Judges of the learned Chief Court, hence, the matter was placed before the learned Referee Judge. 

Upon hearing the learned Referee Ju dge of Chief Court accepted the appeal of the respondent by acquitting the respondent from the charges leveled against him. 

Consequently, the judgment of the learned Trial Court was set aside vide imp ugned judgment dated 28.10.2016, hence, this petition fo r leave to appeal. 7. 

The learned Advocate General appearing on behalf of the State and Mr. 

Manzoor Ahmed Advocate for the petitioner /complainant in Cr. 

Appeal No. 10/2017 submit that it was a day

7 light occurrence which was seen by the eye witnesses of the case. 

They also submit that the accused was nominated in the promptly registered FIR and he was attributed specific role by the prosecution witnesses. 

The complainant was the eye witness of the crime but he passed away befo re examining by the court. 

Per learned counsels PW-02 Jamil s/o Ali Khan is the eye witness who through his statement clearly implicated the accused in the commission of offence and his name is also mentioned in the FIR. 

They further submit that the statem ent of PW -02 could not be shattered by the defence counsel through cross -examination. 

They submit that conviction could be awarded on the evidence of solitary witness and mere relationship of the witness with the deceased party is no ground to discard the evidence under Article 17 of The Qanun -e-Shahadat Order, 1984. 

They reiterate that quality of evidence matters rather quantity of evidence. 

They add that there was no enmity between the deceased and accused party prior to the commission of alleged offence, hence, there is no possibility of any false involvement of the accused in the murder of deceased. 

Per learned counsels the Post Mortem Report, the site plan and recovery of the weapon of offence are corroborative pieces of evidence which connect the accused with the commission of the crime. 

They submit that the prosecution has successfully proved its case against the accused beyond any reasonable doubt but the learned Chief Court fell in error while passing the impugned judgment dated 28.10.2016 in Cr iminal Appeal No. 04/2015. 

Per

============================================================

============================================================

8 learned counsels the said impugned judgment is not tenable and liable to be set aside whereas the judgment dated 28.02.2015 passed by the learned Sessions Judge Gilgit is well reasoned and well founded. 

The learned Advocate G eneral prays that the judgment dated 28.02.2015 passed by the learned Trial Court Gilgit may graciously be maintained whereas the learned counsel for the complainant prays that the conviction/sentences awarded by the learned Trial Court vide judgment dated 28.02.2015 may pleased be enhanced into death sentence. 8. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the petitioners in both the connected appeals, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned judgment dated 28.10.2016 in Cr. 

Appeal No. 04/2015 passed by the learned Chief Court and the judgments of the Division Bench of the learned Chief Court as well as the judgment dated 28.02.2015 passed by the learned Trial Gilgit. 

The careful perusal of the record of the case reveals that the deceased and the accused parties had no enmity prior to the commission of the offence rather they had good relationships with each other. 

Admittedly, an altercation was happened between them on 22.06.1999 in the place of occurrence while playing cricket. 

O n the very next day i.e. 23.06.1999 unfortunately both the parties again quarreled with each other which was ended with the intervention of the complainant and other people present in the place of occurrence. 

The accused in the meantime rushed towards his home and opened fire with a 30 -bore revolver targeting the

9 deceased which landed on his left side of chest resultantly he died while on the way to hospital. 

Although the FIR lodger and Abdul Salam eye witnesses of the offence could not be examined due to their death before recording their statements. 

Similarly, the PW -01, 04 and 06 were abandoned and declared hostile on the request of the prosecution. 

The statement of PW -02 namely Jamil Khan s/o Ali Khan was examined in the court wherein he narrated the sto ry and charged the accused directly giving him specific role with the commission of the murder of the deceased Shahid Jan. 

The statement of said PW is important which is reproduced as under: - P.W-2. 

Jamil s/o Ali Khan “Stated that on 22 -6-99 at about 5 pm. 

I was present on the scene of occurrence that is old polo ground area whereas deceased Shahid and his brothers and the accused Ammar and his brothers were fighting. 

The father of deceased Hajji Inayat Khan separated the figh ting parties, during that accused ran towards his house and from the entrance of his house he fired from his pistol towards the opponent party and the fire shot hit the deceased Shahid. 

After that deceased Shahid removed to the Hospital”. 9. 

The afore mentioned statement of the eyewitness has been corroborated by the Post Mortem Report, the site plan and re covery of the weapon of offence. 

Moreover, the hostile witness is no witness in the eye of law, therefore, mere fact that PWs -01, 03 & 04 have turned ho stile do not give any benefit to the respondent/accused. 10. 

In view of the above discussions, this petition was converted into an appeal and the same was allowed vide our short order dated 04.07.2017. 

The conviction and sentence(s) awarded to
