The learned Advocate General inter-alia submits that Section 23 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 itself provides powers to the special Judge of the Anti -Terrorism Court to decide as to whether the offence is triable by himself or the same is to be transferred to the ordinary Court of jurisdiction. 

He also submits that the learned Judge of the Anti -Terrorism Court has decided to try the case itself which prima facie shows that the provisions of 6/7 of the Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997 were attracted. 

Per learned Advocate General, the alleged offence has been committed in an open public place in front of the Sessions Court, the Civil Courts and to the Chief Court which has created fear and sense of insecurity in the general public, litigants, Judges, lawyers within and outside of the courts premises. 

He adds that this act of the respondents for opening indiscriminatory firing created fear and sense of insecurity in the minds of general public which attracts the provision of Section 6 & 7 of the Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997. 

He submits that the lear ned Chief Court fell in error to consider the above facts and has itself assumed that the murder in question was allegedly committed by the respondents on personal enmity. 

He reiterates that the learned Chief Court observed that offence inserted under section 6/7 of the Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997 has no nexus with the provisions of special law. 

The provisions of Section 6/7 of the Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997 was ordered to be deleted by holding that the case is exclusive ly triable by the Courts of ordinary jurisdiction. 

Per learned Advocate General, the case
