No.16125 of 2022. 2 Scheme issued on 01.07.1942, in Chak No.135/9 -L, Tehsil and District Sahiwal. 

He passed away on 08.01.2017, whereafter his legal heirs continued to occupy the leased land. 

The Colony Assistant reported to the District Collector (respondent No. 2) that the tenancy of the deceased, Muhammad Yousaf, had last been renewed for the period from 01.07.2009 t o 30.06.2014, and no renewal had been granted thereafter. 

Consequently, the legal heirs were alleged to be in unauthorized occupation of the land after 30.06.2014. 

It was therefore recommended that the tenancy be resumed in favour of the State. 

Acting on t he report, the District Collector issued notices to the legal heirs under Section 24 of the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 (Punjab Act V of 1912), with regard to breach of conditions. 

During the proceedings, the District Remount Office r, Sahiwal, submitted a report recommending that the tenancy be re -allotted in favour of the petitioner, Khizar Hayat, who is the son of the previous allottee, Muhammad Yousaf. 

Meanwhile, respondent No. 3 filed an application alleging violation of the tena ncy terms and conditions and seeking resumption of the land in favour of the State. 

After considering the material on record, respondent No. 2, vide order dated 11.06.2021, resumed the land in favour of the State and declared it open for further allotment in the following manner: "ادنرںی احالت بسح افسرش اکولین اٹنٹسس اسویہال رمعب وھگڑی اپل ذہا وبہج الخف ورزی رشا طئ االٹنم/ دعم لیمکت رشا طئ قح کراکر طب ای اجرک Open رقار دای اجات ےہ۔ اٹنٹسس رنشمک اسویہال وک دہاتی یک اجیت ےہ ہک وہ رمعب وھگڑی اپل ذہا وفری وطر رپ طب قح کراکر رکوارک رنو وی فٓ رسی ہقل یک درپداری ںی دںی و ہک افمد کراکر وک وحلمظ اخرط رےتھک وہےئ ا یک اک ہت تالصت اک قاعادعہ

The petitioner challenged above -referred order by preferring an appeal before Addl. 

Com missioner (Revenue), which was allowed vide order dated 29.10.2021 and the matter was remanded to the Deputy Commissioner with the direction to decide the case after getting report in presence of the legal heirs of allottee. 

Relevant portion of the order d ated 29.10.2021 is as follows: " ادنرںی احالت الیپ ذہا وظنمر یک اجیت ےہ اور مکح زری الیپ اکدعلم رقار دای اجات ےہ اور ڈرٹسٹک رٹکلک اسویہال وک دہاتی یک اجیت ےہ ہک سی ذہا ںی اڈیلنشی ڈیٹپ رنشمک(رنو وی) اسویہال ےس ررور ومعق ومبودیگ نیقلعتم/ واراث ےل رک دعب امستع سی ذہا اک ازکرِ ون اطمقب عاون ریم رپ ہلصیف رکںی۔" 4. 

Feeling dissatisfied, respondent No.3 assailed said order through filing Revision Petition (ROR No.2563/21) which was allowed by respondent No.1 through order dated 15.09.2022 in the following manner: "Arguments of both the p arties have been heard at length and record relat ed to Horse Breeding Tenancy has also been perused. 

It clearly reveals from the reco rd that Muhammad Yousaf son of Noor Muhammad tenant under Horse Breeding Scheme in Cha k No.135/9 -L Tehsil & District Sahiwa l died on 08.01.2017. 

The lease period of the said tenаnсу was renewed from 01.07.2009 to 30.06.2014. 

It shows that the respondent intentionally in order to gain the financial benefits cultivated the tenancy without its renewal which is violation of conditions of tenancy.

No.16125 of 2022. 4 Collector after adopti ng all the codal formalities resumed the tenancy in favour of the State. 

The District Collector has rightly imposed Rs.1,1 6,03,250/- as tawan upon the respondent being illicit cultivator for the period from 2014 to 2021. 

The arguments put forth by the lear ned counsel for the petitioner as mentioned in para 3 of this order carries weightage. 

Therefore, I have solid grounds to interfere in the impugned order passed by Additional Commissioner (Revenue), Sahiwal. 

Resultantly, the instant revision petition is he reby accepted, order of Additional Commissioner (Revenue), Sahiwal dated 29 10.2021 is set aside and order of District Collector. 

Sahiwal dated 11.06 2021 is upheld accordingly. " 5. 

Being aggrieved, the petitioner approached this Court through the instant Writ Petition. 6. 

I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and gone through the record with their able assistance. 7. 

After hearing learned counsel for the parties and going through the record it has been observed that late father of the petitioner namely Muhammad Yo usaf s/o Noor Muhammad was a Horse Breeding Tenant. 

After the demise of said allottee, District Remount Officer submitted a report recommending that the tenancy be re -allotted in favour of the petitioner, however, respondent No.3 filed an application alleging violation of terms & conditions of tenancy with the request of resumption of the property in favour of the State. 

Respondent No.2 vide order dated 11.06.2021 resumed the lease land in favour of the State on the ground of viol ation and non - fulfillment of conditions of allotment and directed to start proceedings for re -allotment. 

It was also observed that proceedings should be taken with regard to illegal cultivation and illegal lifting of soil. 

Said order was set -aside by Addit ional Commissioner (Revenue)

No.16125 of 2022. 5 via order dated 2 9.10.2021 with the direction to decide the case afresh in presence of legal heirs of the allottee. 

However, respondent No.1 through order dated 15.09.2022 set -aside the said order and restored the order passed by respondent No.2. 

Now the questions for determination are that when said tenancy shall determine and what will be the procedure for re -allotment. 8. 

In pursuance of the provisions of Sub -Section (2) of the Section 10 of the Colonization of the Governmen t Lands Act, 1912, the Governor of the Punjab issued letter No.2838 -C on 01.07.1942 with regard to "Statement of Conditions" on which Government was willing to grant land situated on the Lower Bari Doba Canal for the purpose of enc ouraging Remount Breeding. 

Condition No.24 of the Scheme provides special conditions of Remount Breeding Tenants which is re -produced below: - (a) No tenant shall have any right or title in the land allotted to him under these conditions or shall enter into possession of the same until he shall have produced a mare which is fit for breeding remounts for the army and which has been approved by an officer of Government appointed for the purpose and braided by him.

As per "Statement of Conditions" on which the Government agreed to grant land in the Colony for the purpose of Horse Breeding, (Correction Slip No.4 -C, M, dated Lahore, the 23rd August, 1934) clause 16 provides that i f the tenant desires to renew the tenancy he has to give notice six months prior to the expiry of that term to the government. 

Said clause is read as under: "16. 

The tenancy shall in the first instance be for a term of 10 year and if the tenant, six months prior to the expiry of that term, gives to the Government and to the District Remount Officer notice in writing of his desire to renew the tenancy and provided that the tenant has carried out the conditions of this grant in all respects to the satisfactio n of the Government and that the Government desire the tenant to continue to breed horses the tenant shall be entitled to a renewal of the tenancy for a further period of 10 years on the same conditions including this condition of renewal, subject to such modifications as regards the number of brood mares to be maintained by the tenant as the Government may consider to be reasonable at the time of such renewal. " Clause 17 deals with the situation when the tenant dies during the period of tenancy or any ext ension, which is as follows: "17.

Later, a Statement of Conditions was enforced by the Government o n 22.09.1977 and condition No.50 of the Scheme had contemplated that if the tenant dies during the period of tenancy or any extension thereof, the land shall revert to the Government and may be granted to any one of his heirs considered to be fully capable of satisfactorily carrying out the conditions of the grant in all respects for the unexpired period of the lease or to some other tenant subject to such compensations to be paid to the estate of the deceased as may be decided by the Collector.

In Letter No.6853 -81/1014 -CL dated 8 -3-1982 the Government has further decided and issued a memorandum on the subject of Horse Breeding Tenancy which i s re-produced below: -- "Memorandum: Under the existing policy instructions, the Horse Breeding tenancies are resumed in favour of the State on the death of a tenant. 

The heirs of the deceased are, however, given preference while allotting the tenancies fal len vacant. 

It has been observed that whenever such an occasion arises and the Collector declares in writing a tenancy to have fallen vacant, before a decision is taken prolonged litigation taken place amongst the heirs of the deceased. 2. 

In order to over come this situation, the Board of Revenue, Punjab have decided that after the death of a tenant when the land stands resumed, the Collector should not declare the tenancy to have fallen vacant. " 12. 

Another statement of conditions was issued by the Gover nment vide Letter No.4292 -83/2537 -CL-1, dated 9 -8-1983 and Condition No.51 of the statement of conditions has provided that if a tenant dies during the period of tenancy the land shall revert to Government and may be granted to any one of his heirs conside red to be fully capable of satisfactorily carrying out the conditions of the grant in all respects for the unexpired period of the lease or to some other tenant subject to such compensation to be paid to the estate of the deceased as may be determined by G overnment on the recommendations of Ministry of Defence of Government of Pakistan. 13. 

In the backdrop of the statutory framework governing Horse Breeding Tenancies, particularly the “Statement of Conditions”

W.P. 

No.16125 of 2022. 11 issued vide letter No.2838 -C dated 01.07.1942, as well as the subsequent policy instructions and memoranda issued by the Government, it stands established that such tenancies are not inheritable as a matter of right; nevertheless, the heirs of a deceased tenant are to be duly considered for allotment, subject to their suitability being assessed by the District Remount Officer and the District Collector. 

The consistent policy position, as is evident from the memorandum dated 08.03.1982 and the revised Statement of Conditions issued on 09.08.1983, is that upon the death of a tenant the tenancy reverts to the Government, yet preference is to be accorded to the legal heirs, and the Collector is obliged to proceed cautiously so as to avoid unnecessary litigation among the heirs by ensuring that any inquiry or fresh assessment of suitability is conducted in a transparent manner and in the presence of all concerned. 

Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, in a case titled "Sub. 

Muhammad Asghar V. 

Mst. 

Safia Begum and another" (PLD 1976 Supreme Court 435), emphasized the heirs of deceased allottee should be given preference and that only those found suitable and capable of fulfilling specialized breeding obligations are eligible for allotment. 

Relevant portion of the judgment is as under: - "Even otherwise, on a true in terpretation of the two memos in question, they only mean that other things being equal, on the death of a lessee with good horse/mule breeding record in those specified Districts, the tenancy should be allotted to the heirs of the deceased in preference t o the outsiders. 

In other words, subject to suitability, the claim of an heir to the allotment must be preferred. 

He is to be allowed this preference in the allotment of the tenancy only in case he is found to be otherwise suitable for it. 

This grant of t he tenancy, as its very name implies, was made for remount breeding. 

Indeed, this was the sole purpose behind

============================================================
PAGE 12
============================================================

W.P. 

No.16125 of 2022. 12 the grant of the tenancy by the Government. 

Under its Statements of Conditions, before entering into possession of the land allotted to him, the t enant is required to produce a mare which is fit for breeding -remount for the army and which has been approved by an officer of the Government appointed for the purpose. 

The tenant is bound to regularly breed from the mare, horses and/or mules as the offic er appointed to supervise the remount breeding operations shall, from time to time,, direct, utilizing only the services of a horse or donkey stallion selected by the said officer. 

He is not permitted to sell or otherwise transfer the progeny of the mare e xcept to the Government at such price as may be determined by the officer concerned. 

It is his duty to maintain and manage the mare and its progeny to the satisfaction of the officer appointed to supervise remount breeding operations. 

This presupposes that only those who are considered suitable to disch arge these obligations of the remount breeding operations are eligible for the allotment. 

This is a condition precedent and the choice is confined to those who are considered suitable and have thus qualified for the allotment. " 14. 

Viewed in this context, the allegation against the petitioner, who is the son of the previous lessee, pertaining to lifting of soil from the leased land cannot, in the absence of a proper inquiry, be treated as a conclusive violati on of tenancy conditions. 

The petitioner’s stance that soil was removed only to level the land and improve irrigation after getting permission, which required factual verification at the spot, particularly when the record shows that no on-ground inquiry wa s ever conducted before recording findings adverse to the petitioner. 

The petitioner also claimed that the period of lease was extended from 01.07.2014 to 30.06.2019 as is evident from the letter No.5/202/Camp dated 22.04.2015 addressed by the District Rem ount Officer, Sahiwal to the District Collector. 15. 

It was for this precise reason that the Additional Commissioner (Revenue), while allowing the appeal on 29.10.2021, very rightly remanded the matter to the District Collector with the direction to obtai n a site report from the Additional Deputy

W.P. 

No.16125 of 2022. 13 Commissioner (Revenue), Sahiwal in the presence of the legal heirs of the deceased tenant and other relevant persons so that the issue of alleged violation could be determined on sound factual footing. 

The Member (Consolidation), Board of Revenue, while passing the impugned order dated 15.09.2022, failed to appreciate this legal and factual position and did not advert to the mandatory procedural requirement of conducting a proper factual inquiry before upholding resumption of the tenancy, thereby committing material illegality. 

In these circumstances, the order dated 29.10.2021 passed by the Additional Commissioner (Revenue) reflects the correct legal approach and ensures adherence to the policy governing Horse Bree ding Tenancies as well as principles of natural justice. 16. 

For the foregoing reasons, this Constitutional Petition is allowed. 

Consequently, the impugned order dated 15.09.2022 passed by respondent No.1 is set aside, and the order dated 29.10.2021 of the Additional Commissioner (Revenue) is restored. 

However, in order to ensure a just, transparent and legally compliant determination of rights, the District Collector, Sahiwal is further directed to conduct a comprehe nsive and factual inquiry into (i) the alleged violation of the terms and conditions of the Horse B reeding Tenancy, including the allegation of lifting of soil from the leased land; and (ii) the question whether the tenancy stood extended beyond 30.06.2014, particularly in view of the petitioner’s assertion and supporting material, including letter No.5 /202/Camp dated 22.04.2015 issued by the District Remount Officer.

The Collector shall also evaluate the candidature of the petitioner for re-allotment of the tenancy by giving due preference to him as the son of the previous tenant, keeping in view the policy position that legal heirs are entitled to priority consideration, and further considering that the petitioner had been assisting his late father in performing the horse breeding obligations and therefore possesses relevant experience, subject to fulfillment of other conditions and suitability requirements of the scheme. 17. 

As regards the imposition of Tawan, the Collector shall specifi cally examine whether during the period of occupation the petitioner or other legal heirs continued to maintain approved brood mares and fulfilled the breeding obligations envisaged under Condition No.24 of the Statement of Conditions; and if it is establi shed that mares were provided and breeding obligations were complied with, no Tawan shall be imposed.
