Per averments of the respondents since the services of the petitioners have been regularized, therefore, their services can not be regularized from the date of initial appointment.

He further submits that whereaf ter there Review petitions have been filed before this apex court which upon hearing were accepted vide consolidated judgment dated 29.04.2015 and the respondents were again directed to place the petitioners before the Selection Board for final selection. 

Per learned counsel the respondents did not comply with the directives of the judgment dated 29.04.2010 and the consolidated Review judgment dated 22.09.2014 passed by this court. 

He submits that the respondents in compliance of the aforementioned judgment s of this apex court regularized the services of some petitioners/incumbents from their initial date of appointment while the services of other petitioners were regularized from the date of First Writ Petition and remaining incumbents have been regularized from the date of meeting of the Selection Board whereas the services of the present petitioners have yet not been regularized and they have been kept on contract basis.

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondents supports the impugned judgment 22.09.2014 in Writ Petition No. 81/2012 passed by the learned Chief Court. 

He contends that initially the petitioners and so many candidates were

4 appointed as lecturers on contract basis but later on for regularization of the posts under contract occupied by the petitioners and other candidates. 

He also contends that the University advertised the posts in Newspaper and consequent upon the advertisement the petitioners and other suitable candidates who were working on contract basis applied for the posts and l ater on joined the process of test/interview conducted by Behria University but unfortunately the petitioners did not qualify the test/interview. 

Per learned counsel the candidates who passed the test were invited to appear before the Selection Board of th e University for interview whereas the petitioners who were failed in the written test were not called for the interview. 

He reiterates that the petitioners who and other candidates who were failed in the written test were disqualified to be appeared befor e the Selection Board of the University. 

The petitioners being aggrieved filed Writ Petition in the learned Chief Court which were dismissed. 

Consequently, the petitioners preferred petition for leave to appeal in this court which upon hearing were decided vide judgment dated 20.09.2008 in CPLA No. 07/2008. 

The petitioners again filed Review Petitions which were also decided through common judgment dated 29.04.2010 by this court wherein modes and method for regularization of the services of the petitioners were made.

5 before the Selection Board for intervi ew whereas the candidates falling in category “B” and “C" are directed to appear before the Registrar of the University and the Registrar was directed to place their case before the Selection Board for final selection. 

He contends that in compliance of the directives of this court the case of the petitioners was placed before the Selection Board resultantly, they appeared but the said Selection Board did not recommend them for final selection on regular basis keeping in view their poor performance. 

He contends that, however, the petitioners were kept on contract basis purely on humanitarian ground. 

Per learned counsel after joining their contract services the petitioners again filed a Misc. 

Petition No. 33/2011 in this apex court wi th the prayer that the judgment dated 29.04.2010 of the apex court may be implemented directing their contractual appointments be regularized. 

This court by accepting the petition directed the authorities of the university to regularize the contractual ser vices of the petitioners and accordingly the university authorities have regularized the services of the petitioners according to the spirit of the judgment of this ape court. 

He contends that there was no directive contained in the judgment for regularizi ng the services of the petitioners from the date of their initial appointment. 

He prays the impugned judgment 22.09.2014 in Writ Petition No. 81/2012 passed by the learned Chief Court may graciously be maintained. 5.
