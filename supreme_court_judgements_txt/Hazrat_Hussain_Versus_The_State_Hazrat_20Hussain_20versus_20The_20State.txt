4 Criminal appeal No. 49/2014 in the learned Chief Court. 

The learned Chief Court upon hearing dismissed the said Criminal Appeal by upholding the judgment of the learned Trial Court vide impugned judgment dated 29.11.2014. 

The operative part of the impugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court for convenience is also hereby reproduced as under: - “Quote”. 

In the light of above discussion, we see no infirmity in the impugned judgment and the same is up held in toto. 

Resultantly, Cr. 

Appeal No. 49/2014 fi led by the convict/appellant is dismissed being meritless. “Unquote ” 6. 

The petitioner/accused feeling aggrieved with the impugned judgment of the learned Chief Court filed Criminal petition for leave to appeal in this court for setting aside the said impugned judgment. 

The notice to the Advocate General Gilgit - Baltistan and to the complainant were issued on 28.08.2017. 

Consequently, the case was heard on 19.09.2017. 7. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned judgment as well as the judgment of the l earned Trial Court are the result of misreading and non -appreciation of the prosecution evidence and other material on record. 

He also submits that there is no credible and inspiring confiden ce evidence on the record to connect the petitioner with the alleged offence. 

Per learned counsel, the learned Trial Court did not consider that the

============================================================

============================================================

5 postmortem of deceased was not conducted and the crime weapon was also not sent for forensic laboratories for expert opinion. 

He submits that the conviction has been based on the statement of complainant and PW -02 namely Umer Farooq which are contradictory in nature. 

He further submits that the FIR was registered after preliminary investigation and after due de liberation & consideration. 

He adds that the PWs are close relatives of the deceased and it is evident from the prosecution case that the occurrence took place in a busy market. 

Despite of availability of witnesses of locality, they associated interested witnesses. 

The complainant’s evidence was not corroborated by any independent witness. 

The recovery of crime weapon and recovery of empty shells were not proved. 

He submits that both the learned Courts failed to apply their judicial minds while passing the impugned judgments, therefore, the same are not sustainable which may graciously be set aside. 8. 

Conversely, t he learned Advocate General supports the concurrent findings of the two Courts below. 

He submits that it was a daylight occurrence and the FIR of same has lodged without any delay. 

The name of the petitioner and names of t wo eye -witnesses have also been mentioned in the said FIR. 

The petitioner was attributed a specific role in commission of crime. 

The weapon of offence has also been recovered from the possession of the petitioner in presence of the independent witnesses. 

He contends

============================================================

============================================================

6 that the said concurrent findings of the two Court s below are well reasoned and well founded which may pleased be maintain ed. 9. 

We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned judgment dated 04.04.2017 passed in Cr. 

Appeal No. 49/2014 by the learned Chief Court. 

In our considered view, the prosecution has successfully proved its case beyond reasonable doubts against the petitioner/convict through unrebuttable and credible evidence which have rightly been appreciated by the learned Court s below. 

The FIR of the offe nce was promptly lodged by the complainant namely Naseemullah (the real brother of the deceased Mehboobullah and the real uncle of minor Majeedullah ). 

The accused was directly charged for double murder. 

The place and time of occurrence and the presence of the petitioner at the place of occurrence has not been challenged by the defence rather it was admitted. 

The eye witnesses i.e. 

Naseemullah PW -01 and Umar Farooq PW -02 corroborated each others and the defence counsel in their cross examinations had badly f ailed to shatter their statements. 

The relationship of eye witnesses with the deceased is not a ground to discard their testimony. 

The ocular testimony corroborates the medical evidence. 

No infirmity and illegality is pointed out by the learned counsel for the learned counsel for the petitioner in both the well reasoned judgments passed by the two Courts below, hence, no indulgence is warranted into its by this court.
