The petitioner /accused being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment of the learned Trial Court filed Criminal appeal No. 46/2014 in the learned Chief Court which upon hearing dismissed by maintaining the judgment of the learned Trial Court. 6. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that four persons were equally charged for pelting stones at the deceased without any specification. 

He also submits that later on a modified story was charged to tight the rope around the neck of petitioner. 

Per learned counsel, the statements of the witnesses are not corroborative in nature rather the same are co ntradictory with one others. 

He further submits that the investigation of the case was conducted dishonestly and the main facts of the case have been intentionally twisted and tailored. 

He adds that there is no postmortem report of the deceased available o n record and only an injury sheet is available on the case file which is not corroborative piece of evidence to convict the petitioner in commission of alleged offence. 

He reiterates that the blood stained stone which was recovered from the place of occurrence by the Investigation Officer (IO) was not sent to chemical expert opinion.

5 justice system. 

The prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case agains t the petitioner beyond reasonable doubts. 

Per learned counsel the learned Trial Court as well as the learned Chief Court fell in error in convicting the petitioner, hence, impugned order dated 18.04.2017 as well as the judgment of learned Trial Court are not sustainable. 

He prays that the said impugned order may graciously be set aside. 7. 

On the other hand, the learned Advocate General supports the impugned order as well as the judgment passed by the learned Trial Court. 

He contends that it was a day li ght occurrence which was seen by the eye witnesses. 

He also contends that the FIR lodger was not an eye witness and he received information from a boy of 12 years. 

The accused namely Sanaullah is directly charged in the promptly lodged FIR. 

The prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt which was corro borated by PW -7 Aslam Khan and PW -8 Nisar Ahmed who have specifically charged the petitioner for fatal injury caused to the deceased. 

Per learned Advocate General, the presence of deceased, PWs and the accused at the place of occurrence is admitted by defe nce. 

He submits that the learned Trial Court as well as the learned Chief Court have rightly convicted the petitioner, hence, impugned order dated 18.04.2017 as well as the judgment of learned Trial Court are well reasoned and well founded. 

He prays that t he said impugned order may pleased be maintained.

We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned order as well as the judgment of the learned Trial. 

Admittedly, the o ccurrence took placed on 12.11.2011 and the accused was nominated in the promptly lodged FIR, attributing him a specific role in commission of the offence. 

The petitioner alongwith the co -accused remained proclaimed absconder till his arrest on 05.03.2013. 

The period of absconsion remained unexplained which is corroborative piece of evidence. 

The eye witnesses namely Aslam Khan (PW-7) and Nisar Ahmed (PW-8) have directly charged the petitioner in committing the crime. 

The said eye witnesses remai ned consistent and corroborated each other. 

Mere relation of the witnesses with the deceased is having no g round to discard their testimony. 

The learned Courts below have rightly appreciated the evidence on record being inspiring confidence while convictin g the petitioner. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner failed to point out any infirmity or illegality in the impugned order/judgment, therefore, we are not inclined to interfere into the concurrent findings of the learned Courts below. 9. 

In view of the above discussions, we converted this Criminal Petition into an appeal and the same was dismissed vide our short order dated 19.09.2017. 

Consequently, the impugned order dated 18.04.2017 in Criminal Appeal No. 46/2014 passed by the learned Chief Court w as maintained. 

These were the reasons of our said short order.
