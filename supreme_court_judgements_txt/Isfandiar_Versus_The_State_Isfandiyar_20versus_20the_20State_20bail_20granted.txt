3 the learned Chief Court and the same be heard and decided expeditiously on its own merit. 

The learned Chief Court in pursuance of the order dated 24.08.2016 of this court heard and decided the Criminal Revision No. 13/2015 vide impugned order dated 22.12.2016 wherein the petition of the petitioner was dismissed. 3. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that after granting bail by the learned Vacation Sessions Judge Gilgit vide order dated 13.02.2015, the same can not be cancelled unless the petitioner misused it. 

Per learned counsel on 07.09.2015 upon submission of challan of the said case, the learned Sessions Court District Diamer has wrongly observed that the bail to the petitioner was granted by the learned Judicial Magistrate Chilas which is without jurisdiction as Section 409 PPC is triable by the Court of Sessions Judge. 

He reiterates that the bail was granted by the learned Vacation Sessions Judge District Gilgit which holds field which was wrongly cancelled by the learned S essions Judge Diamer, hence, the same was no t tenable. 

Consequently, the petitioner filed Cr. 

Revision NO. 13/2015 which upon hearing was dismissed vide order dated 22.12.2016 declaring the same baseless, groundless and based on malafidies on the part of p etitioner. 

Per learned counsel for the petitioner the impugned order dated 22.12.2016 is not sustainable being the result of misconception of law and misreading/non reading of the facts of the case whereas the order dated 13.02.2015 in B.A No. 10/2015 pass ed by the learned
