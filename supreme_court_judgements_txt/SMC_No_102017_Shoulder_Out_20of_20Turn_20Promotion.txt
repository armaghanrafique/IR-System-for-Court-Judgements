EX-CADRE PROMOTIONS: - 4. 

The Police Act, 1861 & Police Rules 1934, envisages the Police Force one indivisible body posses sing various establishments performing assigned functions such as District Police, Reserve Police, Crime Branch, Special Branch, Police Training College and so on. 

Each of these establishments are in fact integral parts of the police force, and under no ru les of construction they can be construed as a separate or independent cadre. 

The appointments and enrollments of the Police personnel are regulated by Rule 12 of the Police Rules, 1934 of Chapter XII, which deals with three different sets of recruitmen t processes described thereunder: - a. 

Recruitment in prosecution (Legal Branch), Rule 12.6(3)(C ). b. 

Recruitment of Technical District, Rule 12.3(B) c. 

Recruitment of upper subordinates in Police, Rule 12.6. 

There is a difference in the training courses of the personnel appointed in the aforementioned units as prescribed in the Police Rules. a. 

Training of personnel: - i. 

Constable, Rule 19.2 ii. 

Upper subordinates, Rule 19.25 b. 

Training of officers in prosecution (Legal Branch ), Rule 19.26. c. 

Training of officers in Technical District, Rule 12.3(B)(2). “After recruitment no Inspector (Legal) shall be allowed to change of cadre from Inspector (Legal) to the Executive of any other Branch in the Police Department”. 

The Supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment dated 04 -11-2015, on Civil Petitions No. 493, 494, 505 to 508, 529 to 532, 533, 601, 906 and 911 to 917 of 2015 has held that, “On the basis of the aforementioned criteria of recruitment and training in terms of the Rules referred to hereinabove, it can be easily concluded Police force has Three independent units i.e. 

Executive, Technical and Prosecution (Legal),. 

On scanning the rules it can be further concluded that Police personnel appointed in terms of the afore said recruitment process cannot horizontally travel to any other unit referred to hereinabove either by way of transfer or otherwise. 

We may, however, observe that Rule 12.8 of Police Rules 1934 provides recruitment

============================================================

============================================================

6 process and training program from Const able to Inspector in the Police Establishment (Executive Unit) is common”. 

Therefore, Police personnel once appointed in any of the abovementioned three independent units i.e. 

Executive, Technical and Prosecution (Legal) cannot legally be transferred, me rged or otherwise to any other unit. 5. 

The leave to appeal titled “DSP Abdul Rauf etc. 

Vs Provincial Government” against the judgment of Hon’ble Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan regar ding merging of seniority of DS Ps Legal with DS Ps of executive Branch of G ilgit-Baltistan Police is sub-judice in the Hon’ble Supreme Appellate Court. 

In pursuance of above quoted police rule and the judgment of Supreme Court of Pakistan, the officer appointed in Prosecution (Legal) & Technical Branch, cannot be merged or transf erred to Executive Police; hence, to give equal opportunity in career progression to the officers in each unit, directions if given for creation of senior cadre posts in their respective units shall be complied with immediately. 

However, no other cases of ex-cadre promotions have been found in Gilgit - Baltistan Police.

A substantial material was received by this Court regarding the “Undue & O ut of Turn Promotion” in Gilgit -Baltistan Police Department. 

Consequently, the case was taken up in Court on 22.11.2017 under Article 61 read with Article 95 of the Gilgit - Baltistan (Empowerment and Self Governance) Order, 2009 (herein called as Order, 2009) read with Article 184(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973. 

Both the aforementioned articles 61 & 95 of the Order, 2009 and Article 184(3) of the constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan are reproduced for convenience as under:- “Quote” ARTICLE S (61) &(95) OF THE GILGIT -BALTISTAN (EMPOWERMENT AND SELF -GOVERNANCE) ORDER, 2009:- Article 61. original jurisdiction: (1) without prejudice to the provisions of Article -71, the supreme Appellate court, on an application of any aggrieved party, shall if it considers that a question of general public importance with reference to the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by part II of this Order is involved, have the power to make declaratory order of the nature mentioned in the said Article.

The power and authority to take Suo Moto notice is available to this Court under Article 61 read with Article 95 of the Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & self Governance) Order, 2009 is akin to the power conferred upon the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan under Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan 1973. 

That in case of conflict between the laws of Pakistan and the laws framed under the Orde r, 2009, the law of Pakistan shall prevail. 6. 

In view of the above provision of law, Article 184 (3) of the Constitution of Pakistan shall prevail while taking Suo Moto action/notice by this Court. 

This Court has taken cognizance of the matter accordingly as question of public importance with reference to the enforcement of any of the fun damental rights conferred by Part-II of the Order, 2009 is involved.

============================================================

41 judgments as provided in the sub articles (2) and (3) of the Gilgit - Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009. 7. 

It is further clarified that under Article 184 (3) of The Constitution of The Islamic Republic of Pakistan regard ing its Original Jurisdiction in case t he Supreme Court of Pakistan, if it considers that question of public importance with reference t o the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter I of Part II is involved, have the power to make an order of the nature mentioned in the said Article. 

Likewise this court in such situation if anything or material comes in its notice, this court in pursuance of Article 95 of the Order, 2009 is empowered to take cognizance as provided under Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan. 

Since, the “Out Of Turn Promotions” in Gilgit -Baltistan is/was unprecedented which relates to the question of general public importance and infringement of fundamental rights to large number of poor police officials, therefore, this court took Suo Moto and heard the case at length. 8.

While hearing this case, we have been fortified by the judgments delivered in an identical nature of cases by the Hon’ble Apex Court of Pakistan i.e. in case titled Shahid Pervaiz v ersus Ejaz

============================================================
PAGE 77
============================================================

77 Ahmed & others reported as 2017 SCMR 206, whereby the larger bench of the Hon’ble Apex Court of Pakistan has held that “Out Of Turn Promotion s” were inherently destructive to the rights of other officers who, though senior and entitled to be considered for promotion before the beneficiaries of “Out of Turn Promoti ons”, were bypassed as a result such out of turn promotions. 

Each out of turn promotion necessarily had a corresponding effected officer, who suffered due to such exercise despite being completely blameless. 

He suffered for such no fault of his own when he was bypassed in favour of beneficia ry of such an exercise unless he voluntarily waved his rights, in which case the promotion could no longer be described as out of turn. 

The Courts ought not to ignore his right in matters brought before it for adjudication, irrespective of his presence or absence before the Court in a particular case. 

Out of turn promotion was not only against the constitution but also against the injunctions of Islam. 

Reward or award should be encouraged for meritorious public service but should not be made basis for out of turn promotion. 

In others identical cases i.e. 

Muhammad Nadeem Arif Versus I.G. of Police reported as 2011 SCMR 408, in case of Ghulam Shabbir versus Muhammad Munir Abbasi reported as PLD 2011 SC 516 & in a case of contempt proceedings against Chief Se cretary Sindh reported as 2013 SCMR 1752, whereby it was held that b runt of out of turn promotions were always borne by the individuals officers who were bypassed. 

The damaging effect on the carriers of the deserving officers who

============================================================

78 suffered due to out of tur n promotion constitute during service and even after retirement in terms of pensionary benefits. 

If the beneficiaries of such illegal exercise were reverted to the positions to which they would have be entitled to, on their respective merits and promotions, it would immediately open up vistas of promotions for those deserving officer who were earlier bypassed due to out of turn promotions. 

Acts of gallantry, no matter how commendable and appreciated by the society did not justify out of turn promotions as they necessarily lead to impingement of the fundamental rights of the fellow officers in terms of blocking their smooth progression of carriers and impinging their respect and honor is protected under Article 9 and 14 of the Constitution. 

Supreme Court di rected the concerned officials and authorities to fix the seniority of all the police officers who were given out of turn promotions alongwith their batch mates as if they were never given out of turn promotions. 10. 

The Hon’ble apex Court of Pakistan w as also pleased to hold in case titled “Aman Ullah versus Government of Baluchistan & 02 other s reported as 2017 SCMR 192 that act of extending favour and conferring benefits of promotions was not only against the fundamental rights of promotions of appellant’s peers on merits but, was also of glaring example of nepotism and undue favour, which act was also opposed to oath o f office of the provincial Chief Minister. 

Out of turn promotions of appellants on the directions of the Provincial Chief Minister could not be sustained.

The Hon’ble apex Court of Pakistan while hearing and deciding various petitions and Review Peti tions reported as 2017 SCMR 868 was also pleased to hold that the concept of “out of turn Promotions” was unconstitutional. 

Police was a disciplined force and officials/officers employed in the police should not have embarked upon unnecessary litigations o f claiming “out of turn promotions”;, if, however, any police official had a genuine grievance he should have taken the same before the forums that the law provided instead of initiating proceedings before the High Court under Article 199 of the Constituti on. 

Provincial Inspector General of police had considered the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court with regard to the “Out of turn promotions cases” and issued notices to all concerned official and gave them opportunity of hearing whereafter he passed sep arate detailed order in respect of each police official. 

The Hon’ble Supreme Court directed that the report of the provincial Inspector General should be acted upon and notifications with regard to withdrawing the “out of turn promotions” be immediately i ssued. 12. 

The Hon’ble Apex Court of Pakistan was also pleased to hold in case titled “Regional Police Officer Gujranwala & another versus Ejaz Ahmed & others ” reported as 2016 SCMR 1525 that no civil servant (or police personnel) was entitled to out of turn promotion on account of gallantry awards or otherwise. 

It has further declared that ante dated seniority to a civil servant is violation of the law.

In case titled “Ch. 

Muhammad Akram versus Registrar Islamabad High Court & others” reported as PLD 2016 SC 961, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that once, the court has satisfied itself that the matter in hand was one that affected the public at large and involved the infringement of fundamental rights protected under the constitution, there remained no bar on its competence to entertain a petition unde r Article 184 (3) of the Constitution. 

In matter of “public importance” if it is directly and vitally concerned the general interest of the community or public at large as opposed to the particular interest of an individual. 14. 

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan was also pleased to hold in another identical case titled Farhat Abbass versus IG & others reported as 2009 SCMR 245 that performance of duty with due diligence and efficiently deserved due appreciation but it could not be over appreciated out of proportion so as to make out a case of grievance to other employees in service of department. 

If a case of glaring favoritism was made out resulting in malafide action, the same had to be rectified in accordance with law to avoid injustice. 

Practice of such Out of Turn Promotion would encourage a person to obtain any other using underhand means or otherwise and then to claim immunity for such acts which would, therefore, result in rewarding the person using such means by allowing him to

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan was also pleased to hold in case titled Ali Azhar Khan Baloch v ersus Province of Sindh & others reported as 2015 SCMR 456 that Civil Servant exhibiting act of gallantry while performing his duties. 

The word gallantry as used in S. 9 -A of the Sindh Civil Servant Act 1973, could only apply to police personnel and award & reward on their gallantry performance should be conferred upon them and not to other species of Civil Servant. 

Such award or reward, however, should be given under a transparent process after objectives assessment of their valour by a committee, in a just manner under the prescribed rules. 16. 

We have heard the learned Advocate General appearing on behalf of the Government of Gilgit -Baltistan alongwith the learned Secretary Home and the learned DIG on behalf of the Inspector General of Police Gilgit -Baltistan, perused the material on record, gone through the report(s) submitted by the Police Department Gilgit -Baltistan and the Home Department Gilgit - Baltistan respectively. 

We have also perused the “Annexure -U” which shows the police officers/officials of Police who have been promot ed without fulfilling the codal formalities of th e Mandatory Requisite Training and Courses. 

The same is reproduced hereunder: -

It is shocking to note that how and in what manners they were promoted Out of Turn by violating the Mandatory Requisite Trainings and Courses. 

It is settled principle that violation of any mandatory provisions are not condonable under any law which vitiates the whole process of such illegal and unconstitutional Out of Turn Promotions. 

Such promotions are inherently destructive to the rights of the officers who though s enior and entitled to be considered for promotions before the above beneficiaries of Out of Turn Promotions were bypassed and there were deprived from well deserved promotion on merits. 

The aforementioned case laws and parameters laid down by the Hon’ble apex Court of Pakistan are fully applicable and enforceable in this case as well. 

We have also gone through the provisions of Article 61 & 95 of Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009 and Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Isla mic Republic of Pakistan 1973. 

The perusal of the aforementioned Statues, case laws, and the Police Service Rules, transpires that admittedly the Officers/Officials of the Police Department Gilgit -Baltistan have been granted Undue / Out of Turn Promotions, Prom otions without fulfilling the Codal/Formalities i.e. without obtaining the pre -requisite trainings and/or promotions with out lawful authority. 

Due to granting of the

============================================================
PAGE 84
============================================================

84 aforesaid Promotions, the batch -mates/colleagues of the beneficiaries have been deprived from their due promotions/ seniority rights and they have been discriminated which could not be encouraged by this Court. 

The Gilgit -Baltistan Police is a disciplined force which has the pivotal role in maintaining the “law and Order situation” in the ent ire region. 

They should always have been appreciated by providing them each and every due rights in terms of their promotions etc, so as, their moral may always be boost up /beefed up. 

In our considered view, the notion of “out of Turn Promotion” is uncons titutional, illegal, unlawful, illegitimate and against the fundamental rights conferred under Chapter –I of Part- II in the Constitution of The Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as well as enshrined in the Articles 03 to 19 Part-II of the Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment and Self -Governance) Order, 2009, therefore, such Out of Turn Promotions are not tenable in the eyes of law. 

The Promotion to the Civil Servants could only be granted on the basis of their seniority -cum-fitness after completing c ertain legal codal formalities by the competent authorities as prescribed by the Civil Servants Rules as well as Police Rules. 

Out of turn promotions causes injustice to other colleagues/batch -mate s which certainly creates frustration, disappointment and disturb ance to those who are/were deprived & suppressed in circumstances. 

The Officers/Officials of Gilgit -Baltistan police who performs bravery, gallantry and diligent services must be awarded/ rewarded with due appreciation but they cannot be granted/given “Out of turn

============================================================

============================================================

85 Promotions” and/or promotions without completing the Requisite Mandatory Courses and without fulfilling the codal formalities of the prescribed Services /Police Rules by creating an environment of frustration, annoyance and sense of depravity amongs t all officers/ officials of Police on the basis of glaring favoritism, nepotism, partiality, political motives and malafidy, which is, of cour se, is considered to be illegal, unconstitutional, ab-initio void and without lawful authority. 18. 

Both t he Constitution of Pakistan & the Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self -Governance) Order, 2009, provides security of person to their life and liberty. 

The term “ life and liberty ” is significant as it covers all the facets of human existence. 

The inhabitation against its deprivation extends to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed. 

The term “life” includes ‘reputation’ ‘status’ and all other ancillary privileges which the law confers upon the citizen. 

The Civil Servants are fully protected unde r Article 9 of the Constitution as well as under Article 3 (Part -II of the Fundamental Rights of the Order, 2009, who cannot be deprived from their right of reputation, status and opportunity of the promotions in next grades /scales by discriminating them a nd depriving them from their due rights. 

The granting of “Out of Turn Promotion, unlawful and undue promotions to the beneficiaries would not only be unconstitutional without undertaking competitive and transparent process but would also deprive the senior ity and progression of the career of other meritorious Police personnel. 

The

============================================================
PAGE 86
============================================================

86 out of turn promotions given by the then authorities of Gilgit - Baltistan police does not creates a perpetual right to the beneficiaries gained on the basis of illegal order (s) which can be set aside at any time. 19. 

The case in hand is a case of general pubic importance with reference to the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights as prescribed in Part -II of the Order, 2009 is involved which has far reaching effects on the service rights of Police officers/officials of the Police of Gilgit -Baltistan; therefore, this court was constrained to take Suo Moto notice in order to redress the ir grievances. 20. 

In view of the above discussions and parameters laid down by the Hon’ble apex Court of Pakistan, we, vide our short Order, dated 05.04.2018, have set aside all the “Out Of Turn Promotions” made till date by directing the Police Authorities to revert all such illegal beneficiaries back to their original ranks/ positions /posts. 

The learned Home Secretary and the Inspector Gener al of Police Gilgit -Baltistan were directed to submit compliance report within two (02) weeks positively. 21. 

As submitted by the learned DIG Gilgit, certain nece ssary Shoulder promotions given to certain police officials purely on temporary basis in their own pay and scale were requested to be maintained, if so required, with the permission of learned Inspector General of Police Gilgit -Baltistan. 

The request was allowed accordingly.

Before parting with this judgment, we appreciate and acknowledge the services rendered by Mr. 

Jawad Akram learned Home Secret ary Gilgit -Baltistan and Mr. 

Gohar Nafees, the learned Deputy Inspector General of Police for their proper assistance to this Court.
