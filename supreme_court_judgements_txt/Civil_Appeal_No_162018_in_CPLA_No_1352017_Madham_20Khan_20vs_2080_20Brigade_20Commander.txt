4 5. 

We have heard the learned counsel s for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record and gone through the concurrent findings of the learned three Courts below. 

The learned Chief Court while concurring with the views taken by the First Appellate Court and the Court of fi rst instance do not appear to have suffered from misreading on non -reading of evidence. 

Further, the learned counsel for the petitioner also could not point out any infirmity or illegality in the well reasoned impugned order passed by the learned Chief Cou rt, hence, interference into concurrent findings of the three Courts below is not warranted by this Court. 6. 

In view of the above discussions, we convert this petition into an appeal and the same is dismissed. 

Consequently, the concurrent findings of th e learned three Courts below are affirmed. 7. 

The appeal is dismissed in above terms.
