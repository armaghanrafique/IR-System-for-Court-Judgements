2 Gilgit -Baltistan, who passed order in one line and the petition was dismissed in limine without giving any reason vide order dated 27.08.2013, which is against the natural justice. 2. 

He further contends that two (02) independent transactions had been undertaken between the parties i.e one transaction between one Muha mmad Jami and the respondent while the other transaction between the petitioner and one Kareem Ullah Khan, as such two independent cause of actions arisen in different occasions. 

The present respondents tried to engage the petitioner in the subsequent transaction which cannot be sustain ed as the subsequent transaction has a new cause of action which is not disputed. 

He finally contends that the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court dis missed the Writ Petition of the petitioner vide order dated 27.08.2013 which is not tenable in law hence, the same is require to be set aside. 3. 

Conversely, the learned counsel for the respondents supports the impugned order of the learned Gilgit -Baltist an Chief Court. 

He submits that the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court has rightly dismissed the Writ Petition of the petitioner as the same was filed against order dated 22.05.2012 passed in Civil Revision No. 21/2012 which was not main tainable. 

He fina lly submits that the impugned order dated 27.08.2013 passed by the learned Gilgit - Baltistan Chief Court may graciously be maintained being well reasoned and well founded.

3 4. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned order dated 27.08.2013 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court. 

In our considered view the impugned order dated 27.08.2013 is not a speaking order as no reasons have been given while dis missing Writ Petition in limine. 5. 

In view of the above discussions, we convert this petition into an appeal and the same is allowed. 

Consequently, the impugned order dated 27.08.2013 passed by the learned Gilgit - Baltistan Chief Court is set aside. 

The case is remanded back to the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court to hear the parties afresh whereafter decide the same on its own merit s. 6. 

The pe tition is allowed in above terms.
