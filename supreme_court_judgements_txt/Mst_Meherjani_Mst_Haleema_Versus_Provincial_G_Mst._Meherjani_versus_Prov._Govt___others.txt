The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners are the owners of the disputed land which has been acquired by the respondents for constru ction of the building of Boys Middle School Chila Dass Astore without paying compensation to the petitioners. 

He also submits that the petitioners being aggrieved filed Civil Suit No. 58/92 and 72/94 before the learned Trial Court Astore who upon hearing decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiffs/petitioners in ac cordance with law and facts of the case. 

He further submits that the respondents being aggrieved filed Civil First Appeal before the learned District Judge Astore which upon hearing was dismissed and the judgment of the learned Trial Court to the extent of delivery of structure/buildings and compound interest was allowed. 

The respondents being aggrieved filed Civil Revision No. 06/2013 which upon hearing was allowed vide impugned judgment dated 22.08.2013.
