PS to Secretary, Law, Justice and Human Rights Division, Islamabad. -Sd- (SAJID MIAN) SECTION OFFICER (NA -II) The learned A dvocate General Gilgit -Baltistan further contended that the respondent did not implead the necessary parties i.e. 

Chairman Gilgit -Baltistan Council, Secretary Kashmir Affairs & Northern Area and Federal Minister Kashmir Affairs & Northern Area, who were competen t authority for appointment of Judges of the learned Chief Court while f iling Writ Petition No. 19/2012 before the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan. 

He also contends that the benefits given to the Ex - Chairman of Chief Court (Muzaffar Husain Malik ) by the competent forum i.e. the Federal Service Tribunal Islamabad vide judgment No. 

M.P.No. 1422/2006 in appeal No. 1869(R) CS/2005 dated 04.04.2008, not by the Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan. 

Secondly, Mr. 

Muzaffar Hussain Malik was the Chairman Chief Court Northern Areas whereas the respondent was given acting charge Cha irman till appointment of regular Chairman and he was also retired as Member in BPS -21 and he is availing the pension benefits since his retirement. 

He also contends that the learned Chief Court Gilgit - Baltistan did consider the relevant provision of law while passing the impugned Judgment and the arguments of the petitioners have also not been considered thereto. 

While saying so, he relied upon reported Judgments in case of West Pakistan Industrial

The learned Advocate General alongwith Assistant Advocate General further contends that the respondent being a Civil servant in BPS-21 has no locus standie to file Writ Petition and the learned Chief Court has wrongly entertained, adjudicated and decided the said writ petition despite having no jurisdiction. 

Furthermore, the equal status of High Court was given to the Chief Court in the year 2007, whereas the respondent retired on 13.11.2004. 

It was further substantiated by promulgation of “The Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009”. 

He also contend s that the Doctrine of Laches & Principle of Estopple att ract barring the respondent to file Writ Petition before the learned Chief Court as the respondent remained silent for a considerable period of eight (08 ) years and the same has not been considered by the learned Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan while

============================================================

8 passing the impugned Judgment hence no tenable. 

He finally contends that the impugned Judgment in Writ Petition No. 19/2012 dated 04.12.2013 is the result of misconception of law, misreading and non -reading of the material /Notification & order 1994, 1998 and 2009. 

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent supports the Impugned Judgment. 

They submit that the respondent retired as acting Chairman Chief Court Gilgit - Baltistan (the then NAs ), Gilgit on 13.11.2004 attaining the age of superannuation (62 years) in ter ms Northern Area Chief Court Establishment (Second Amendment ) Order 2002. 

The respondent was allowed acting Charge of the post of Chairman Gilgit -Baltistan (the then NAs) Chief Co urt vide Notification No. 

F.1/1 -97-11 dated 14.02.2004. 

They also submits that the respondent was not confirmed as Cha irman Chief Court till his retirement because the respondent was being actively considered and summary was moved for respondent’s elevatio n as member Supreme Appellate Court. 

The summary was kept pending in the meantime the respondent retired as Acting Chairman Chief Court. 

The Chairman Chief Court was given perks, privileges and pensionary benefits as admissible to a serving of High Court Judge vide Notification No. 

NA-II- 21/1/87 dated 8th June, 1994, whereas the Members were given perks, privileges as to an officer of BPS -21. 

The former Chairman Mr. 

Muzaffar H ussain Malik was given pension ary benefits as admissible to a Judge o f the High Court. 

He further submit s that

============================================================

============================================================

9 although the respondent was approved by the Prime Minister of Pakistan for elevation as Member Supreme Appellate Court but subsequently his approval was not notified and the respondent alongwith Mr. 

Muzaffar H Malik were dropped despite the fact that there was nothing adverse against the respondent. 

He further submit s that the respondent as Acting Chairman was getting pay and allowances as admissible to the Chairman. 

The respondent applied for the pension in BPS -21 at that time as the same was an option for him submit revised pension case as admissible to a Judge of High Court. 

He further submit s that the respondent was constrained to apply for pension in BPS -21 as he was facing financial hardship s He referred Article 260 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 wherein, the Chief Justice has been defined as under: - “Chief Justice” in relation to Supreme Court or the High Court, includes the Judge for the time being acting as Chief Justice of the court”. 

He submit s that the perusal of the above referred article reveals that the respondent was Acting Chairman, Chief Court, Northern Area meaning thereby the respondent was Chairman Chief Court, as such, the respondent is entitle to get pension and other privileges as a Judge of High Court. 

While saying so he relied upon the reported cases i.e. i. 2006 SCMR 1983 ii. 1995 SCMR 650 iii. 2005 SCMR 25, iv. 

PLD 1996 SC 324.

10 He finally submits that the impugned judgment in Writ Petition No. 19/2012 dated 04.12.2013 passed by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan is in accordance with law and no -interference is warranted in to it. 

We have heard the learned Advocate General Gilgit - Baltistan assisted by the learned Assistant Advo cate General as well as the learned Counsels for the respondent at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned judgment as well as the case laws relied upon by both the learned counsel for the respective parties. 

The case laws referred by the learned Advocate General are applicable and the case laws relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent are distinguishable. 

Admittedly, the respondent retired on 13.11.2004 whereas vide Notification No. 

F.No.1 ( 16)/99 -NA-II dated 28.04.2008. 

The Chairman and Members of the Chief Court Northern Area have been renamed as Chief Judge and Judges of the Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court. 

Subsequently, under Article 69 (13) of “The Gilgit - Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Govern ance) Order, 2009 ”, the remuneration & other terms and condition of Service of Chief Judge and Judges of Chief Court shall be as such admissible the Chief Justice and Judges of High Courts of Pakistan. 

In view of the above, we accept the appeal and set as ide the impugned judgment in Writ Petition No. 19/2012 dated 04.12.2013 passed by the learned Chief Cou rt Gilgit -Baltistan. 

These were the reasons for our Short Order dated 12.11.2015.
