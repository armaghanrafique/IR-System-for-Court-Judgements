3 learned counsel the petitioner is very hard worker, honest, duty full and loyal to his duties a nd quite competent in his filed as c ompare to the respondent No. 01. 

The promotion of petitioner was made on the principle of his eligibility i.e. seniority -cum-fitness. 

He submits that the learned Chief Court fell in error by holding that re - designation a nd further promotion of the petitioner was unjust based on malafidy and void ab -initio, while passing the impugned judgment which is not sustainable. 4. 

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent No. 01 supports the impugned judgment dated 19.11.2013 in Writ Petition No. 76/2012 passed by the learned Chief Court. 

He contends that the respondent was senior to the petitioner as he was appointed as Helper BPS -01 in the year 1978 whereas the petitioner was appointed in the year 1980 as Helper BPS-01. 

He also contends that the official respondent s have not considered the respondent for further promotion and he was discriminated. 

The respondent No. 01 was co nstrained to file the Writ Petition which was accepted by the learned Chief Court. 

Per learn ed counsel the re -designation of the post of the petitioner from Foreman to Supervisor BPS -07 was malafidy on part of the authorities of the PWD. 

He contends that since the respondent was discriminated, therefore, the learned Chief Court has rightly accept ed the Writ Petition of the respondent. 

He prays that the impugned judgment be affirmed being well reasoned and well founded.

We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned judgment dated 19.11.2013 in Writ Petition No. 76/2012 passed by the learned Chief Court. 

Admittedly, the respondent w as senior to the petitioner having unblemished record who has been discriminated and deprived f rom his fundamental right of promotion. 

The learned Chief Court has rightly accepted the Writ Petition filed by the respondent No. 01. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner also could not point out any illegality and infirmity in the said impugned judgment. 6. 

In view of the above discussions, we convert this petition into an appeal and the same is dismissed. 

Consequently, the impugned judgment dated 19.11.2013 passed in Writ Petition No. 76/2012 by the learned Chief Court is affirmed. 7. 

The appeal is dismissed in above terms.
