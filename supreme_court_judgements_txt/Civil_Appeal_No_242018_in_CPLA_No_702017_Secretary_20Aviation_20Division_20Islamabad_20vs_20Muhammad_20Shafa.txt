This court vide order dated 06.09.2017 issued notice to the respondent and the case is heard today. 2.

2 Aviation Authority (CAA) Gilgit. 

The respondent retired vide office order No. 

GT/4511/2/02828 dated 18.08.2015 on the ground that the he has attained the age of superannuation. 

Being aggr ieved, the respondent filed Writ Petition No.105/2015 in the learned Chief Court contending therein that the said order for retirement of respondent is against facts and record as his actual date of birth is 01.02.1957. 

He is entitled to com plete his age o f superannuation accordingly. 

The petitioners in reply of the said writ petition submitted their parawise comments and denied the claim of the respondent. 

The CNIC number of respondent originally issued to him was 750 -54-077177 and Form -B of respondent con tains the same number /year of his birth i.e. 1954 which is also part of his service record. 

Upon hearing, the learned Chief Court allowed the writ petition filed by the respondent vide impugned order dated 28.02.2017, hence, this petition for leave to appeal. 3. 

Mr. 

Aftab Asif, Airport Manager, Gilgit is present in court today and states that the learned Chief Court did not consider the fact about the date of birth of respondent which is evident from his CNIC No. 750 -54-077177 and Form -B of respondent in which the date of birth is mentioned as 1954. 

He submits that the respondent failed to prove his date of birth through documentary evidence. 

It is a mystery o n whose authority the Medical Board was constituted to assess the age of respondent? Where are the recommendation of such Medical Board who opined the date of birth of respondent as 01.02.195 7 instead of 01.07.1954? He prays that the impugned

3 order dated 28.02.2017 passed by the learned Chief Court may graciously be set aside. 4. 

On the other hand, Malik Kifayat -ur-Rehman appearing on behalf of the respondent supports the impugned order pass ed by the learned Chief Court. 

He contends that the petitioners have wrongly retired the respondent as he has not attained the age of superannuation on the basis of his date of birth i.e. 01.02.1957. 

Per learned counsel, the learned Chief Court has rightly allowed the Writ Petition No. 105/2015 filed by the respondent vide impugned order dated 28.02.2017. 

He prays that the said impugned order passed by the learned Chief Court may pleased be maintained. 5. 

We have heard Mr. 

Aftab Asif, Airport Manager, Gilgit as well as the learned counsel for the respondent at length, perused the materials on record and gone through the impugned order passed by the learned Chief Court. 

Admittedly no Medical Board was constituted to determine the age of the respondent. 

No certificate was ever issued by any Medical Board determining the age of respondent as claimed. 

On the contrary, from the CNIC No. 750-54-077-77 of the respondent it is evident that the date of birth was shown as 1954. 

Further, the respondent being in government service has not approached the competent authorities for correction of his age within first two years of his services. 

In our considered view, the impugned order is not well reasoned and well fou nded, hence, the same is not sustainable.
