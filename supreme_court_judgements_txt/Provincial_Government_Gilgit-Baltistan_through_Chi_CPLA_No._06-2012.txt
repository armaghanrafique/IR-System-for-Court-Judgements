The afore -reffered petition was allowed b y the Chief Court vide order dated 21.12.2011 in terms as under: - “The petitioner has been re -instated in response to the Judgment of this Court dated 24.11.2010, which was upheld by the Supreme Appellate Court on 26.05.2011, but the respondent No. 2 in vi olation of Court Order without allowing back benefits. 

This petition is disposed of with the strict direction to the respondent No. 2 for allowing back benefits to the petitioner as have been ordered by the Court. 

Petitioner can move afresh if deprived hi m after reasonable time. 

Petition disposed of accordingly. 

File” 4. 

The petitioner feeling aggrieved assailed aforesaid order dated 21.12.2011 in CPLA No. 06/2012 before this Court. 5. 

Arguing the case, the learned Advocate General Gilgit -Baltistan has submitted that the impugned order is against facts and record and that the Hon’ble Chief Court never applied its judicious mind while handing down said judgment. 

He submitted further that the matter of payment of back benefits was left to the discretion of competent authority and as such, learned Chief Court could not take up the matter and thereafter, direct the payment of back benefits. 

It has been argued further that the learned Chief Co urt exercised its jurisdiction illegally with material irregularity and the order has been passed without taking into consideration the actual controversy and as such the same is liable to be set aside. 6. 

Arguments heard and record perused. 7. 

The trend and ten or of the order dated 26.05.2011 mentioned above clearly reflects that the authority was only given the mandate to hold regular inquiry, if so desired. 

It nowhere dealt with

postponement of payment of back benefits till conclusion of inquiry if so initiate d against the respondent herein. 

In view of judgment mentioned supra, there remains no room for doubt that the respondent is entitled to recover back benefits as per orders of this Court dated 26.05 -2011 and no exception can be taken to it. 

We have perused impugned order very carefully and found no illegality at all which may require interference. 8. 

Upshort of the whole exercise is that the impugned order is in accordance with law and never calls for any interference. 9. 

The petition is dismissed. 

Leave refused.
