2 2 First Appellate Authority i.e. 

The learned District Judge Hunza/Nagar in its judgment dated 14.06.2013 in Civil Appeal No.05/2013. 

The petitioners being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said impugned judgment filed Revision No. 53/2013 before the learned Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan, which upon hearing was accepted and the judgments of both the court s below were reversed vide its order dated 0 4.04.2014. 

Being a ggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned Judgment passed by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan in Civil Revision No.53/2013 dated 04.04.2014 the petitioners challenged the said judgment in this court with the contention s that the same is illega l, incorrect and arbitrary and based on non -reading and non appreciation of evidence on record, hence, the same is not sustainable and liable to set aside. 

He further contends that the impugned judgment dated 04.04.2014 is based merely over opinion s and conjectures and surmises which caused the miscarriage of justice.

3 3 Hunza/Nagar and the learned First Appellate Court Judge/District Judge Hunza/Nagar be maintained. 

We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners, perused the record and gone through the Judgment passed in Civil Revision No.53/2013 dated 04.04.2014, by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan, which is, in our considered view is well reasoned and well founded. 

Since, no illegality and infirmity has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioners in the said impugned Judgment, therefore, we are not inclined to grant leave to appeal in the instant petition. 

Leave is accordingly refused. 

The order/Judgment dated 14.06.2013 in Civil Revision No. 53/2013 passed by the learned Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan is maintained. 

Leave refused.
