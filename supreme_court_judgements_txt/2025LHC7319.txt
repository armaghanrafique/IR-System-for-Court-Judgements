Respondents by: Mr.

MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.-This consolidated judgment shall dispose of instant appeal along with connected appeal i.e. 

RFA No.57639 of 2023, as common questions of law and facts are involved in these cases. 2. 

Through these appeal s, appellant s i.e. 

National Highway Authority ( “NHA” ) in titled appeal and Provincial Government through Land Acquisition Collector in connected appeal, have challenged the legality and validity of order and decree dated 02.05.2023, passed by learned Senior Civil Judge, Gujranwala, whereby Reference Application under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (“the Act of 1894”), filed by respondent s No.1 & 2, was allowed in the following terms: - “40. 

In view of my findings on above issues, this reference U/S 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 is accepted and petitioners are held entitled to get market value as claimed by them coupled with amount of damages sustained due to acquisition proceedings, com pensation for future potential of property, additional compensation for

2 RFA No. 54593 of 20 23 & connected case reverence, injurious affection, disturbance, loss of profits, change of place of business and delay in conclusion of acquisition proceedings which is calculated as under: -  Rs.20-lac pe r acre (off road)  Rs.20-lac per acre (link road)  Rs.20-lac per acre (severed land ) thus petitioners are held entitled to get enhanced compensation as above alongwith 15% compulsory acquisition charges and 8% compound interest from the date of possess ion till the execution of this order or payment of remaining compensation by National Highway Authority / respondent No.2. 

These issues are decided in favour of petitioners. ….. 

Compound interest would continue to accrue till such time that the entire com pensation is paid in its entirety. 

Once the original amount has been deposited (in court), the matter goes out of the penal consequences of section 34 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. ….. 36. ….. 37. 

Non mentioning of criteria to determine compensation and drag petitioners into litigation clearly depicts that respondents did not honour right of petitioners and due to their demeanor, petitioners had to bear expenses in the assertion of their rights before Court and section 35 CPC provides that costs are t o be awarded to reimburse successful party for expenses incurred by him. 

So, petitioners will be entitled to costs which will follow the event. 

Costs of suit includes fee of Advocates, court fee, process fee, postal service expenses, publication in newspap er, summoning of witnesses, summoning of record, expenses borne for securing documents from public / Government Offices, petitioner’s travelling expenses, adjournments in reference etc. 

Costs of the suit / reference mentioned in decree sheet / memo sheet s hall be paid by Collector who wrongly determined compensation whereas amount of enhanced compensation will be paid by National Highway Authority / respondent No.2 / Acquiring Agency. 

Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. …..” 3. 

Brief facts of the case ar e that respondents No.1 & 2 filed a Reference Application challenging the award No.0 9/2017 dated 10.08.2017, announced by the Land Acquisition Collector, Kamoke for acquisition of land in question, situated in Mauza Dholan for the purpose of construction o f Lahore - Sialkot Motorway Project in Tehsil Kamoke, District

3 RFA No. 54593 of 20 23 & connected case Gujranwala, whereby t he respondents No.1 & 2 were awarded compensation of Rs.11,50,000/ - per acre for land at Link Road and Rs.11,00,000/ - per acre for off road land alongwith 15% compulsory acq uisition charges. 

The appellant -NHA filed written repl y. 

Out of divergent pleadings of the parties, the Referee Court framed following issues: - ISSUES: 1. 

Whether market value of the suit property / acquired land of petitioners was Rs.17,00,000/ - per acre an d the same was wrongly fixed @ Rs.1 1,00,000/ - per acre in the absence and without notice to the petitioners vide award dated 10.08.2017 by the Land Acquisition Collector? OPA 2. 

Whether the petitioner is entitled to receive the price of the land @ Rs.17,00,0 00/- per acre alongwith interest? OPA 3. 

Whether the petitioner has not come to the Court with clean hands? OPR 4. 

Whether reference of the petitioner is barred by time and the same is liable to be dismissed? OPR 5. 

Whether the reference of the petitioner is lia ble to be dismissed under Order VII Rule 11 CPC? OPR 6. 

Whether the petitioner has no cause of action and locus standi to file this reference? OPR 7. 

Whether the reference of the petitioner is not proceedable in its present form due to mis -joinder and non -joinder of necessary parties and the same is liable to be dismissed? OPR 8. 

Relief After recording evidence and hearing arguments from all sides, the Referee Court, vide order and decree dated 02.05.2023, allowed the Reference Application in the above manner. 

Hence, instant appeal. 4. 

Learned Legal Advisor for appellant -NHA, duly assisted by learned Law Officer, submits that the compensation was enhanced without determining the average market price of the land while ignoring Rule 10(1)(iii)(c) of the Punjab Land Acquisition Rules, 1983. 

He adds that respondents No.1 & 2

============================================================
PAGE 4
============================================================

4 RFA No. 54593 of 20 23 & connected case failed to prove the exact price as well as location of acquired land, thus, were not entitled to exorbitant compensation. 

He maintains that the market value was to be assessed on the basis of pric e existing in preceding year of the date of issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. 

He adds that as the maximum compensation was awarded, therefore, respondents No.1 & 2 were not entitled to 08% compound interest. 

He fur ther states that the documentary evidence, adduced by respondent s No.1 & 2, was exhibited / marked in the statement of learned counsel, therefore, the same has no evidentiary value in view of dictum laid down by the superior Court s. 

Lastly, he submits that since the available record, evidence and applicable law have not been properly appreciated by learned Referee Court, therefore, impugned decree is liable to be set aside. 

In support of his contentions, he has relied upon Ghulam Muhammad v. 

Government of W est Pakistan (PLD 1967 Supreme Court 191), Government of N. - W.F.P. and others v. 

Akbar Shah and others (2010 SCMR 1408), Manzoor Hussain (deceased) through L.Rs. v.

Conversely, learned counsel for respondents No.1 & 2 defends the impugned order and decree by contending that learned Legal Advisor for appellant -NHA as well as learned Law Officer have failed to pinpoint any illegality or legal infirmity therein, thus, same is liab le to be upheld. 

He maintains that r espondents had filed objections under Section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, but the LAC mala fide failed to decide them; the award dated 10.08.2017 was passed at their back, rendering the entire process non -transp arent. 

He contends that a ppellant’s own written reply amounts to an admission of respondents’ claimed market rate. 

He adds that e ven if respondents’ documentary evidence is ignored, appellant’s own witness (RW-3) admitted market values of Rs. 143,750 /- per Marla (link road) and Rs. 137,500 /- per Marla (off road), which admission alone justifies enhancement far beyond what the Referee Court eventually awarded i.e. 

Rs. 20,00,000/ -, as such the learned Referee Court rightly applied Section 23 Act ibid, conside ring future potential, location, severance, and comparative advantages of the land in line with the judgments of the Hon’ble superior Courts. 

In support, he has referred to Fazalur Rahman and others v.

I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with their able assistance. 7. 

Record reveals that respondents ’ Reference Application was decreed ex parte vide order and decree dated 03.04.2019, whereby compensation value was fixed @ Rs.17,00,000/ - per acre alongwith interest @ 6% per annum starting from acquisition of land till amount of award. 

However, the aforesaid decree was set aside while accepting application under Section 12(2) CPC, filed on behalf of appellant -NHA and respondents were directed to implead the NHA as respondent to the Reference Application, which was later on decreed and the

============================================================

============================================================

7 RFA No. 54593 of 20 23 & connected case amount of compensation already awarded by learned Referee Court was enhanced along with award of costs of suit, as detailed in commencing paragra ph of this judgment. 

Appellant s are not satisfied with the decision of the Referee Court and are urging to restore the award announced by the Land Acquisition Collector. 8. 

The pivotal issues No.1 & 2 are inter -linked and inter - connected, hence are decide d jointly. 

The remaining issues No.3 to 7 have not been pressed before this Court. 

However, learned counsel for respondents submits that as the petitioner received the compensation without any protest, therefore, the Reference was not maintainable. 

This co ntention is not legally tenable. 

Although reliance has been placed on Mark -C to assert that the respondents accepted the awarded compensation without protest, the appellant -NHA failed to discharge the essential evidentiary burden of producing the relevant payment register or any other primary record to substantiate this assertion. 

No effort was made to summon the said register through a formal application either. 

In the absence of the primary documentary evidence, the mere reliance on a marked document, uns upported by the original record, cannot be treated as conclusive proof of unconditional receipt. 

Moreover, during cross -examination, AW -2 categorically stated that the respondents had received the compensation under protest. 

This statement remained unshake n and was never rebutted by the appellant -NHA through any admissible evidence. 

In land acquisition proceedings, where the right to seek a reference is sought to be defeated on the ground of “acceptance without protest,” the acquiring agency must establish this fact through clear and unimpeachable evidence. 

The failure of the appellant - NHA to do so creates a presumption in favour of the respondents, and the statutory bar under Section 31(2) cannot be invoked in such uncertain circumstances. 

Given this

============================================================
PAGE 8
============================================================

8 RFA No. 54593 of 20 23 & connected case eviden tiary position, the objection raised by the appellant -NHA has no factual foundation, and the reference cannot be declared incompetent on the basis of an unproven allegation of unconditional receipt. 9. 

It is pertinent to note that under the settled legal principles, a claimant who files an application for reference under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, challenging the adequacy of the compensation, shall be deemed to have received the awarded amount under protest. 

The Act does not prescribe any specific mode or form of protest; it may be made either orally at the time of receiving the compensation or impliedly by filing a reference within the prescribed period. 

In the present case, although respondents Safdar Ali and Arshad Ali did not expressly mention “under protest” on Mark C, the receipt of compensation / Qabzul Wasool dated 11.08.2017, the filing of their Reference Application on 10.08.2017 sufficiently demonstrates an implied protest against the award. 

The absence of a written mention in th e Qabzul Wasool (Mark -C) is a mere technicality and does not disentitle the respondents from claiming enhanced compensation under Section 18 of the Act. 

Therefore, the objection of the appellants’ side regarding acceptance of compensation without protest i s without merit and is accordingly overruled. 

Reliance is placed upon Wali Ahmad v. 

Collector, Land Acquisition and others (1985 SCMR 224), Zardad Khan and others v. 

Government of N.-W.F.P. and others (1987 SCMR 1387 ), Qazi Badr -ul-Wahab and 20 others v. 

Land Acquisition Collector, Provincial Housing Authority, Peshawar and 3 others (2019 YLR 851 ), Muhammad Yaqoob through Legal heirs v. 

Land Acquisition Collector (M-4) National Highway Authority and 4 others (PLD 2021 Lahore 364) and Federation of Pakistan v.

9 RFA No. 54593 of 20 23 & connected case 10. 

The core controversy is whether the compensation assessed by the Land Acquisition Collector represents fair and just compensation, or whether the valuation determined by the Referee Court, within the contemplation of Sections 23 and 24 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, constitutes the correct measure. 11. 

Admittedly, Notification u/s 4 of the Act of 1894 for acquiring land in question situated in village Dholan, Tehsil Kamoke, District Gujranwala was issued on 09.06.2016 and the Award (Exh.A 9) was announced on 10.08.2017, according to the valuation approved by the District Price Assessment Committee, whereby compensation @ Rs.11,50,000/ - per acre for link road and Rs.11,00,000/ - per acre for off road was fixed. 

Whereas learned Referee Court fixed the amount of compensation for the land in question as Rs.20,00,000/ - per acre for off road, Rs.20,00,000/ - per acre for link road and Rs.20,00,000/ - per acre for severed land. along with a dditional monetary benefits i.e. 15% compulsory acquisition charges, 8% compound interest from date of possession until full payment, continuation of i nterest until entire compensation is paid, damages & ancillary compensation and c osts of litigation particularly advocate fee. 12. 

The learned Referee Court enhanced the compensation on the basis of respondents’ documentary evidence as Exh.A -1 to Exh.A -12, and Mark -A to Mark -D. 

These documents were tendered in the statement of learned counsel, which was not permissible under th e well -established principle enunciated by the superior Court s including cases reported as Manzoor Hussain (deceased) through L.Rs. v. 

Misri Khan (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 749), Mst.

Muhammad Afzal Bhatti and another (2024 CLC 1246). 13. 

However, it is a matte r of record that both the parties have relied upon and tendered the minutes of the meeting of the District Price Assessment Committee in their respective evidence. 

As t he respondents having produced the same document as Exh.A -4, and the appel lants as Mark RW -A, the authenticity thereof cannot now be disputed, and the Court is justified in taking it into consideration in the interest of fairness and due process. 

The respondents are satisfied by the valuation made by the Assistant Collector, Kam oke, who determined it @ Rs.17, 50,000/ - per acre for Link Road and Rs.17,00,000/ - per acre for Off Road. 

Furthermore, the respondents themselves admitted in para 3 of their reference the market rate of Rs.17,00,000 /- per acre and did not claim Rs.20,00,000 /- per acre for any classification of land. 

The learned Referee Court though referred to aforesaid valuation of the Assistant Commissioner, Kamoke, but award ed Rs.20,00,000 /- per acre, which is not only excessive but also wholly beyond the respondents’ own pleaded stance. 

Thus, the impugned compensation award ed by learned Referee Court appears to be unsupported by the pleadings, contrary to the respondents’ admissions, and lacking any credible market evidence. 14. 

Even otherwise, n one of the members of the Committee was produced in evidence to explain the criteria adopted by it while fixing the price. 

Earlier, in similar circumstances, this Court in the case of Mubashar Hussain Awan, supra, while relying upon the report of the field staff, duly mentioned in the Award (Exh.A2), decreased the amount of compensation. 

The aforesaid judgment has been upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.
