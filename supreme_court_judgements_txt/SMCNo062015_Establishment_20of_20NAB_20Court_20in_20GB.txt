Subject: - NOTIFICATION REGARDING ASSIGNING ADDITIONAL CHARGE OF NATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY COURT GILGIT -BALTISTAN TO MR. 

MEHR IJAZ SAIL, JUDGE CUSTOMS AND BANKING COURT GILGIT -BALTISTAN Please refer to the Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan letter No.CC -E-4(1)/20145 dated 4th September, 2015 on the subject. 2. 

This is to intimate that the observations of the Honourable Chief Judge Chief Court GB have been considered and it is stated that all codal formalities shall be strictly followed at the time of regular appointment of Judge NAB court, however, at present only additional charge has been conferred to Mr. 

Mehar Ijaz Ali Sial, Judge Banking & Customs, Gilgit -Baltistan on the request of Law & Prosecution Department Gilgit -Baltistan till the regular appointment. 

It will not be out of place to mentio n here that such an arrangement was made in the past also and no such observations were made by the honourable Chief Judge, Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan, infact the worthy Chief Judge was pleased to dismiss Writ Petition No.35/2013 vide orders dated 02 -09-2013 wherein the petitioners had challenged the additional charge entrusted to Mr. 

Malik Safdar, the then Judge Banking & Customs. 3. 

The worthy Chief Judge, Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan may kindly be apprised of the above said position and informed that all codal formalities shall be observed at the time of regular appointment, he may be further requested to allow Mehar IJaz Ali Sial Judge Banking & Customs to perform his duties as Judge NAB Gilgit -Baltistan on additional charge basis till the t ime of regular appointment. -Sd/- (Muhammad Ajmal Gondal) Joint Secretary Ph: 051 -9253261

5 I have gone through all the aforementioned Notifications, reply of Gilgit -Baltistan Council and impugned Administrative Order dated 04.09.2015. passed by the learned Chief Court Gilgit - Baltistan. 

Admittedly, t he appointment of Mr. 

Mehr Ijaz Ali Sial as Banking/Customs Judge Gilgit -Baltistan was made by the Gilgit - Baltistan Council with the consultation and co nsent of the learned Chief Judge, Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan. 

The impugned Administrative Order dated 04.09.2015 passed by the learned Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan appears contradictory to its own Court’s Judgment in Writ Petition No. 35/2013 dated 02.09.2013 regarding the additional charge given to Malik Safdar, the then Banking/Customs Judge as Judge of National Accountability Court, Gilgit -Baltistan. 

In view of the above discussion, i n my considered view since Mr. 

Mehr Ijaz Ali Sial was lawfully appointed as Judge of Banking/Customs Court Gilgit -Baltistan and he was given additional charge of Judge of National Accountability Court Gilgit - Baltistan, no consultation and consent was required afresh from the learned Chief Judge, Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan by the Gilgit - Baltistan Council. 

In view of the above discussion, the impugned Administrative Order passed on 04.09.2015 by the learned Chief Judge, Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan is set aside. 

The Order vide Notification No. 

C -4(2)/201 3 GB Council dated 21.08.2015 issued

The Copies of this order be sent to all concerned /departments for implementation of this order. 

The SMC No. 06/2015 is disposed off in above terms.
