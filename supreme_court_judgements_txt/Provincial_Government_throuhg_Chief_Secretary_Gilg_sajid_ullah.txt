Before facts are that the above petitioners got acquired the land for construction of Civil Cou rt and residential quarters/ houses in Sub - division Shounter. 

The land in question was initially acquired from Pakora Dass in 2008 later o n the project was shifted to Gorikot Astore in the year 2010, on the basis of enhancement through civil reference /objection under section 34 of Land Ac quisition Act, 1984 before Refere e Judge, District Astore on 22 -11-2010, holding that the respondents/obj ectors are entitled to receive compensation on the prevailing rates of Rs. 300,000/ -(three lac

only) per kanal plus 15% compulsory charges with interest at the rate of 8%compound interest per annum. 3. 

Present pe titioners filed their written reply refu ting th e claim of present respondents/ objectors before starting the development scheme notice to persons interested in the case were issued under section 4 Land Acquisition Act vide notification dated 10 -06-2008, subsequently notices followed thereof and final notice under section 12, was issued on 29 -05- 2010, and fulfilled all the mandatory provisions of Land Acquistion Act. 4. 

In the light of pleadings issues have been framed by the Referee Judge. 

Parties of Suit produced their respective evidence pro and contra, ultimately the Referee Court passed a decree in favour of present respondents Felling aggrieved by the judgment the p etitioners filed Civil 1st Appeal before the learned Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan the learned Chief Court upholding the judgment of Referee Court and dismissed the appeal of the petit ioners. 

Hence this petition for leave to appeal. 5. 

We have carefully examined the contentions as agitated on behalf of the petitioners by the lea rned Advocate General Gilgit - Baltistan, in the light of relevant provisions of law and record of the case. 

Moreover

============================================================

the concurrent judgments passed by learned Division Bench and Referee Judge Astore, has been perused with care and caution. 

The entire documentary evidence also been thrashed out with arguments advanced by the learned Advocate General. 6 It has been also observed by this Court, that, all notice were issued in the year 2008 for land situated in pakora Dass and scheme has been shifted to Gorikot. 

The prese nt petitioners in the year 2010 have completed the acquisition proceedings, without giving fresh notice under Section 4 of Land Acquisition Act. 

Hence the pr esent petitioners clearly violate the mandatory provisions of land Acquisition Act. 7. 

What we have observed from available record, is that the award dated 29 -05-2010 has been prepared on old rates of compensation, and the notices under sections 1 2(2), -9-A,5 A, and notice under section 4 Land Acquisition Act, would reveals that present petitioners have done nothing after issuance of notice under section 4 in the year 2008 to 2010. 

In the year 2010 the petitioners have acted in hurry to acqu ired the Land without proportionate the shares of respondents, this has been confirmed by the petitioner’ s representative.

8. 

We also observed that notice served by collector under Land Acquisition, are general notices, in which no specific names are mentioned of owners. 

Moreover, the representative of petitioners during cross examination confirmed that enhanced up to Rs. 3,00,000/ - ( three lac only ) per kanal in the year 2008. 

The present petitioners have badly failed to challenge this admission Before the R eferee Judge. 

For what has been discussed above, we have not been able to find out any substantial grounds or reasons for interference in the judgment of Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan and Referee Court, and consequently dismissed this petition. 

Leave to appeal refused.
