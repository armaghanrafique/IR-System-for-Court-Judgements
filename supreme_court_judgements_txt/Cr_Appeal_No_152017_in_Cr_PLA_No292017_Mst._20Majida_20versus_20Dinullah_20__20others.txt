This court vide order dated 03.07.2017 issued notices to the respondents/accused but nobody appeared on behalf of them. 2. 

Briefly, the facts of the case are that on 18.03.2017, the respondent/accused alongwith their princip al accused name ly Saeed-ur-Rehman abducted one Mst.

2 were taking the victim lady in a car bearing No. 

GLT -6811 driven by accused/re spondent Dinullah. 

The accused took the victim girl in a Hotel in Gulmit Gojal, where the main accused namely Saeed -ur- Rehman reportedly committed sexual intercourse with her. 

The local police registered FIR No. 07/2017 on 18.03.2017 under Section 376, 365-B/34 PPC against the respondents/accused. 

The accused after their arrest were interrogated and subsequently they were sent to judicial lockup. 

The accused Din Ullah filed bail application in the learned Trial Court which upon hearing was dismissed vide order dated 18.05.2017. 

The respondent Din Ullah & Muhammad Nabi preferred Criminal Misc. 

No. 71/2017 & Criminal Misc No. 73/2017 in the learned Chief Court for grant of bail which upon hearing were accepted and grant ed bail to the respondent/accused, hence, this petition for leave to appeal. 3. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the respondents/accused have been nominated in the FIR who were involved in the abduction of the petitioner. 

He also submit s that respondents were intercepted by the police red handed while travelling in a car alongwith the petitioner after abducting her. 

The offences committed by the respondents/accused are heinous in nature and against the society as well. 

The punishment provided for the said offences is life imprisonment, therefore, bail granted to them is not sustainable. 

He submits that the learned Trial Court has rightly refused the grant of bail to the respondents/accused whereas the learned Chief Court fell in error while granting them

3 bail on the grounds of further inquiry which is not tenable. 

He prays that the bail granting order graciously be recalled. 4. 

We have heard the lea rned counsel for petitioner at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned order dated 25.05.2017 passed by the learned Chief Court. 

The tentative perusal of the record of the case file transpires that the respondents/accused have not been attributed any specific role in the commission of the alleged offence. 

Further, t he learned counsel for the petitioner could not point out any illegality or infirmity in the impugned order passed by the learned Chief Court. 5. 

In view of the abov e discussions, the leave to appeal is refused. 

Consequent thereto, the impugned order dated 25.05.2017 passed by the learned Chief Court is affirmed. 6. 

The leave is refused.
