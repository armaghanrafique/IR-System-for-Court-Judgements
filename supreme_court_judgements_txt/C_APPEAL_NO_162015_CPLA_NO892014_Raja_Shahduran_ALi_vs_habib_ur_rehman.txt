All the referred cases are discussed on date of hearing, in which no limitation is provided. 7. 

We have gone through the case file orders/ judgments of lower courts, and also perused the evidence provided by the respondent before trial cour t, the evidence so produced by the respondent, could not establish the absence of respondent in Gilgit City. 

The evidence produced by the respondent before learned t rial court, could not established and substantiate, the case, considering t he evidence as a whole and arri ving at a certain conclusion on the basis thereof, these are three things which are kept in view of the volume of evidence and probability of evidence. 

It is cumulative effect of all three aspects of evidnce that finally determines a certain question of fact. 

The respondent has badly failed to substantiate his non availabiltiy at Gilgit City. 

We are in opin ion that, the respondent could not established his case. 

We are inclined to accept the petition for leave to appeal convert, into appeal and the same is allowed, setting aside the
