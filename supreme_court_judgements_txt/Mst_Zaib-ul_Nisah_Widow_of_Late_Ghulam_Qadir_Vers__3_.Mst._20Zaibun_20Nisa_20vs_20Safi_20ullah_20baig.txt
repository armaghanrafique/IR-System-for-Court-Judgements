the Court of learned Rent Controller Hunza, District Gilgit by respondent/petitioner for the ejectment of the petitioner/defendant from the shop No. 1 owned by the respondent/petitioner. 

The respondent herein was the owner of shop No. 1, 2 and 4 situated in Japan Chowk, Karimabad Hunza. 

The aforementioned shops were rented out to Ghulam Qadir husband of the petitioner/respondent, who later on had died. 

The parties had executed an agreement dated 10 -03-2004 to the e ffect that the possession of rented out shops would be handed over to the respondent/petitioner on the expiry of contract period i.e. three years. 

The late husband of the petitioner/respondent had already vacated the shop No. 2 and 4 and the possession was handed over to the respondent in his life time. 

It is noticeable that the possession of shop No. 1 had remained with said tenant and on the sad demise of the lessee, his wife petitioner herein did not vacate the shop No. 1, nor the possession of the shop in question was handed over to the respondent herein. 

Since she had stepped into the shoes of her husband and continued her business in the shop, she was asked to vacate the shop time and again but in vain. 

The respondent was left with no other remedy exce pt to approach the Court of competent Jurisdiction. 

In view of the divergent stands of the parties the learned Rent Controller framed as many as 08 issues.

The petitione r/respondent filed a second appeal against the aforesaid order before the Chief Court Gilgit - Baltistan which was also dismissed vide judgment dated 17-05-2012.
