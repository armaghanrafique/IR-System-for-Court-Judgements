This Contempt Petition No. 03/2012 was filed by the petitioner namely Sabir Hussain against the Secretary Education contending therein that this court vide order dated 29.11.2011 in SMC. 

No. 29/2011 had directed the respondent No. 01 i.e.

2 the test nor their names were included in the merit list. 

He submits that the respondents had committed willful breach of a valid assurance given before this apex court as such they are become liable for punishment under the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 read with Article 75 of the Gilgit-Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009. 3. 

He finally submits that this apex court may be pleased to take legal action against the respondents by awarding them punishment for willful disobedience and violation of order/direction dated 29.11.2011. 

He prays that the respondents are directed to issue appointment letter of the petitioner to meet the ends of justice. 4. 

On the other hand, the learned Advocate General contends that the petitioner namely Sabir Hussain son of Wazir Shah appeared in written test of OT teacher (BPS-14) but he could not qualify the said test. 

He contends that the petitioner obtained only 04 marks out of 15 while the minimum marks for passing the test were 05 marks. 

Per learned Advocate General the instant contempt petition filed by the petitioner is baseless, unfounded and without any cause of action. 

He finally contends that the Secretary Education is not competent to create a post or convert a post of male quota into female quota, therefore, this contempt petition No. 03/2012 is the result of misconception of law and facts of the case, hence, the same is liable to be set aside.
