The petitioner is of the view that initially 3 accused namely Shakoor the present petitioner, one Naseer and Jam Gull were implicated. 

The co -accused Jam Gull was released by the police under section 169 Cr. 

P.C. while accused Nase er was granted bail by the Trail Court vide order dated 26 -03- 2013. 

The counsel for the petitioner is of the firm view that merits of the case are of the nature which call for further inquiry and the entitlement of bail to the petitioner/accused. 

Secondly that equal role has been attributed to all the nominated accused, hence the petitioner is entitled for the concession of bail on the grounds of consistency, party and equality. 

The story put forwarded by the prosecution is full of doubt, improbabl e and cannot be take into account. 

The incident as narrated in the F.I.R. disclosed that it is a night occurrence supplemented by rain, hence the identification of accused is not probable in the dark circumstances with the torch light. 

The state on t he other hand is of the view that the petitioner/accused is directly charged for the commission of offence by fire shot opened by him. 

The weapon of offence has also been recovered proving that offence has been committed in the manner stated. 

The statement of eye witnesses alonghwith the other material placed on record makes a good prima -facie case against the petitioner/accused.

We have given through to the contentions raised by both the parties and have also perused the record. 

The F.I.R. 

No. 50/12 of Police Station City Chilas clearly discloses the presence of the witnesses as well as the direct nomination of the accused, and the separate role played by them. 

It is observed to have opened the fatal fire shot at the deceased and his role in the commissi on of offence is not at par with the role played by other co -accused because direct charge of the fatal fire shot has been attributed specifically to the present petitioner/accused. 

The role of the released co -accused is not at par with the present case. 

S econdly the statement of PW’s as well as the recovery of other articles has not been constructed after any fatal delay which may raise doubts in the manner in which the occurrence has taken place. 

It would not be necessary to comment on the other parts of the case and would not be appropriate to go into further details of the case as it would be fatal to the final outcome of the matter. 

The other discussion and reasons given in the present order may not influence the trail judge during the proceedings as the circumstances may change after the adducing of the evidence. 

In view of the above mentioned facts we are of the view that the concession of bail is not granted in favor of the

petitioner/accused as there is a prima facie case existing against th e petitioner/accused.
