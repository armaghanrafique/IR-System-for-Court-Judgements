DATED OF HEARING: - 17-09-2015. 

JUDGMENT. 

Dr. 

Rana Muhammad Shamim,, CJ …….The learned Advocate General Gilgit -Baltistan contends that the Food and Agriculture Department, Government of Gilgit -Baltistan advertised various posts on 14.08.2011 including posts of Assistant Civil Supply Inspectors ( ACSI) BPS -05 and only one post was filled in and one Muhammad Yaqoob S/o Sair Ali was selected after taking test/interview as he got first position as per merit list. 

Subsequently, 02 more posts of Assistant Civil Supply Inspector BPS-05 were created/ sanctioned. 

The respondent No.2 Abdul Jahan was selected against one of the said posts. 

He further submits that the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan by following an out dated analogy of selection allowed the petition filed by the respondent No.01 vide Wri t Petition No. 90/2012 on 25.03.2014 and directed the appellants to appoint him for the post applied for as he got 2nd position in the merit list. 

While accepting the petition and passing the following order setting the things correct: - (A). 

Respondents No.1 to 4 are directed to issue /pass office order appointing petitioner with effect from 1st

September 2012 (01.09.2012 ) against the posts of ACSI BPS -05 in the department of respondents No. 1 to 4. (B). 

Petitioner be placed aft er Mr. 

Mr. 

Muhammad Yaqoob in the seniority list of ACSI BPS -05 of the Department of respondents’ No. 02 to 4. (C) Respondents NO. 01 to 04 pay arrears of full pay with allowance to the petitioner with effect from 01 - 09-2012 against the post of ACSI BPS -05. (D) Respondents No. 1 to 4 to submit their compliance report of above order within one month from today, failing which to show cause that why they should not be proceeded for violating merit in making appointments in v iolation of the merit list referred in the petition and also for none compliance of this order. 

The learned Advocate General further submits that the order dated 25.03.2013 in Writ Petition NO. 19/2013 passed by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan based on misconception and on an out dated analogy of selection and the same is liable to set aside.

On the other hand, Mr. 

Amjad Hussain the learned counsel for the petitioners submits that since two posts of Assistant Civil Supply Inspection (B PS-05) were not admittedly advertised in the newspapers and against one of those posts one Abdul Jahan S/o Abdul Qayoom has been selected/appointed by the appellants secretly as he got 3rd position in the test/interview, whereas, the respondent No.1 Fiaz A hmed S/o Abdullah Khan was ignored inspite of the fact that he got 2nd position in the test/interview as per merit list. 

He was ignored by the appellants for the best reason known to them, which is contrary to the fundamental rights guaranteed under articl e-71(2) of Gilgit -Baltistan (Self Empowerment and Governance) Order, 2009 as well as the enabling articles of the constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. 

He further contended that the respondent No.1 has preferential right over the respondent No.2 fo r the appointment for one of the said two vacant posts as per final merit list, which is against principle of natural justice and equity. 

He further submits that the learned Advocate General Gilgit -Baltistan appearing on behalf of the petitioner could not find out any infirmity and illegality in the impugned judgment dated 25.03.2014 in Writ Petition No.19/2012
