============================================================

6 Quote. “In the light of what has been discussed above we are of the opinion that prosecution has established guilt of the appellant and the learned Trial Court has rightly convicted the appellant for the subject occurrence. 

In the peculiar circumstance of the case we have taken judicial notice of the fact that appellant and the complainant part are inimical terms in the perspective of a history of chained bloodshed. 

In this connection the FIR and other pieces of prosecution evidence are sufficient establ ishing the said chained of bloodshed between the appellant and complainant party. 

So we are inclined to convert death sentence of appellant into life imprisonment and while doing so we are accepting the inimical history between appellant and complainant pa rty as a mitigating circumstances. 

So appeal in hand is partly accepted to the extent that we have upheld the conviction of the trial Court on one hand but have converted the death sentence awarded to the appellant through impugned Judgment/order into life imprisonment. 

The other sentences awarded through impugned Judgment/order are upheld ”. 

Unquote 7. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that it is a case of brutal murder of day light in the main bazaar of Chilas. 

The local Police soon after the occurrence apprehended the respondent No.01 from some distance alongwith weapon of offence i.e. 30 -bore pistol. 

The convict accused was directly charged in the promptly lodged FIR and according to the version of the FIR the accused has specific role in commission of the offence. 

He further submits that the motive of the murder of the deceased has also been mentioned in the FIR which has been fully established through material evidence on record. 

He also submits that the ocular evidence of the

============================================================

============================================================

7 case has fully supported by Medical evidence, recoveries of article of crimes, report of crime weapons, empties, blood stained earth, cloths, autopsy report and Forensic report etc. 

He further submits that FIR No. 97/2010 under Section 302/114/34 PPC, read with Section 13 Arm Ordinance was lodged on 23.11.2010 in Police Station Chilas Diamer against the convict/respondents No.01 to 03 on th e allegation of opening fire on the deceased Karim Dad Alias Hatoo and killing him in Chilas Bazaar. 

He further contends that upon proving guilty, the learned Trial Court convicted and sentenced the respondents No.01 Muhammad Ishaq under Section 302(b) to death. 

He was also ordered to pay Rs. 4,00,000/ - (Rupees four lac only) as compensation under Section 544 -A Cr.PC to the legal heirs of the deceased while respondents No.02 and 03 namely Kalar Muhammad and Sakhi Muhammad although fully involved were acquit ted giving them benefit of doubts by the learned Trial Court whereas, t he co -accused namely Wali Muhammad son of Juma Muhammad was declared proclaimed offender. 

Since the respondents No. 01 & 02 with common intention of each other with respondent No. 01 co mmitted murder of deceased Karim Dad alia Hatoo, were liable to be convicted.

8 into death sentence to meet the ends of justice. 

In support of their arguments he relied upon the case laws reported as 2011 SCMR 1148, 2003 SCMR 522, 2014 PCr. 

LJ 885 and 2014 PCr. 

LJ 1366. 

The learned Advocate General adopts the arguments of learned counsel for the complainant/petitioner. 8. 

On the other hand, the learned counsels appearing on behalf of the respondents contend that according to the prosecution it is day light offence occurred in the main Bazaar in presence of a lot of people but no independent witnesses of locality were associated. 

They also submit that inspite of the fact that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the respondents beyond any shadow of doubt and the conviction awarded to respondent No. 01 is not sustainable. 

They add that it is a settled principle of law that the benefit of doubt, if any, always goes to the accused. 

They also contend that the statements of PWs are doubtful and contradictory with one others and t he alleged recoveries are also not reliable which have been affected against the mandatory provisions of law. 

They finally submitted that the case against the respondents is of clean acquittal and the learned Trial Court has wrongly awarded Capital Punishment to the respondent No. 01 which has been upheld by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court, however, the sentence of death was reduced into life imprisonment in mitigating circumstances. 

While saying so they relied upon the case law repo rted as 1973 SCMR 12, 2007 P.Cr.LJ 27, 2008 SCMR 707, 2013 PCr. 

LJ 931, 2002 MLD 964, 2012

We have heard the learned counsel s for the respective parties at length, perused the case file and gone through the impugned judgment dated 09.10.2013 in Criminal Appeal No. 23/2011 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court as well as the judgment dated 23.11.2011 of the learned Trial Court District Diamer. 

The case laws cited by the learned counsel for the respondents are distinguishable whereas the case law s relied by the learned counsel for the petitioner are applicable. 

In our considered view the prosecution has successfully proved its case against the respondent No. 01 beyond any shadow of doubt. 

Further the motive of committing murder of deceased Karim Dad alia Hatoo was proved through materi al evidences on record. 

No mitigating circumstances exist to reduce the sentence of convict Muhammad Ishaq. 10.
