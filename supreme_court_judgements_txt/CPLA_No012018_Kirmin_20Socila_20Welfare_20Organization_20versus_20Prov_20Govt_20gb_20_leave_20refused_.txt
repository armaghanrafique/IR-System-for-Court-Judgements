ORDER. 

This petition has arisen out of the impugned judgment dated 05.12.2017 passed in Writ Petition No. 06/2017 by the learned Chief Court whereby the said Writ Petition filed by the petitione rs was dismissed being devoid of any merit whatsoever, hence, this petition for leave to appeal. 2.

2 any merit with the observations that the said Writ Petition falls under the mischief of laches. 

He contends that the learned Chief Court fell in error while dismissing the Writ Petition which is not sustainable in law. 3. 

We have heard the Advocate -on-Record for the petitioners at length, perused the materials on record and gone through the impugn ed judgment passed by the learned Chief Court. 

The perusal of the record makes it evident that the development scheme titled “Construction of 10 bed hospital at Chupurson Gojal” was approved in the year 2016. 

Consequently, the Administrative Approval of th e said development Scheme was issued after completing all the codal/formalities from the quartered concerned. 

The learned Advocate -on-Record for the petitioners could not point out any infirmity & illegality in the well reasoned impugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court, hence, no interference is warranted into it. 

Consequently, we are not inclined to grant leave to appeal. 

The leave is accordingly refused. 4. 

The leave is refused.
