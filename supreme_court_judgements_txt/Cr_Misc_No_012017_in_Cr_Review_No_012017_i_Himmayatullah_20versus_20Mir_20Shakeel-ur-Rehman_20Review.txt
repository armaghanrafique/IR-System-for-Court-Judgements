2 XXIII Rule 7 of The Supreme Appellate Court Rules 2008. 

As per petitioner, no limitation runs for filing review petition against the said void Common Impugned Judgmen t. 

It is further averred that the delay in filing this Cr. 

Review Petition is not intentional nor negligence o n the part of the petitioner which, however, is not substantiated with any supportive case law(s). 3. 

The grounds raised in the said application for condonation of delay are not reasonable and plausible, hence, the same cannot be considered as held by th is Court in cases reported as 2016 GBLR 12 and 2016 GBLR 244 and by the apex court of Pakistan in cases reported as 1990 SCMR 1377, 1991 SCMR 1022, 1998 SCMR 292, 1998 SCMR 1087, whereby it is held that even one day unexplained delay in filing the petition(s) was not condoned. 4. 

Mr. 

Muhammad Issa senior Advocate for the respondent No.01 submits that Mir Shakeel -ur-Rehman was/ is the only target of the petitioner for ulterior motives as the Review Petition s, against the rest of three (03 ) petitio ners in Cr. 

Appeal No. 15/2016 namely (i). 

Ms. 

Shaista Lodhi (ii). 

Ms. 

Veena Malik and (iii). 

Mr. 

Asad Bashir Khatak, were not filed who were also acquitted alongwith Mir Shakeel -ur-Rehman vide said Common Impugned Judgment dated 30.09.2016 passed by this Court. 

The Review Petition filed only against the respondent Mir Shakeel -ur-Rehman is discriminatory in nature. 

Per learned counsel, the respondent No.1 Mir Shakeel -ur-Rehman has no concerned with the management of

3 the “Morning Show” telecast in question. 

The said show was organized and managed by the Independent Media Corporation which is a private corporation. 

Nei ther the respondent NO.01 Mir Shakeel -ur-Rehman was the Director or Member nor the Manager/Organizer of the sai d Morning Show. 

He reiterates that the respondent No. 01 Mir Shakeel -ur-Rehman was neither a share holder nor any Executive Director of the “Geo Channel ” in terms of section 156 of The Companies Ordinance 1984. 

He also submits that the petitioner misinterpreted Order XXIII Rule 7 of The Supreme Appellate Court Rules 2008 which deals with the condemned prison ers. 

He prays that the Common Impugned Judgment passed by this Court is well reasoned and well founded, hence, Review Petition filed by the petitioner is not maintainable and liable to be dismissed. 

The learned Advocate General Gilgit - Baltistan has not controverted the law laid down by this Court and by the apex Court of Pakistan regarding the dismissal of petition (s) on the point of u nexplained delay even for one day. 5. 

We have gone through the averments made by the petitioner in Review Petition, heard the learned counsel for the respondent No.01 Mir Shakeel -ur-Rehman, the learned Advocate General for respondent No.02, The State and also gone through the case laws referred above. 

The Order XXIII Rule 7 of The Supreme Appellate Court Rules 2008 referred by the petitioner in support of condonation of delay is also not applicable. 

No infirmity and illegality is pointed out in the Commo n Impugned Judgment of this
