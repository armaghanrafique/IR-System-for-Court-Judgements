2 2. 

Briefly the facts of the case are that the respondent was appointed as District Coordinator Gilgit under Aurat Foundation Waseela Taleem (BISP) at a gross salary of Rs. 50,000/ - (rupees Fifty thousand only) per month for a period of two (02) years wit h effect from 01.06.2013 vide appointment order No. 

HO/HR/344. 

Later on her services were terminated on 15.09.2014 vide order No. 

AF/HO/HRD/MI/03/2014 issued by the respondents. 

The respondent being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with filed Writ Petition No. 100/2014 before the learned Chief Court which was allowed as prayed for. 3. 

The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that Aurat Foundation is a none -Governmental Organization and the respondent was appointed as District Coordinator purely on contract basis for a period of two years but her services were terminated on account of abolishment of the impugned post. 

He also submits that the respondent had no locus standi to file the writ petition being the employee of a non -governmental Organization similarly the learned Chief Court has no jurisdiction to entertain such writ petition. 

Per learned counsel the impugned judgment dated 31.03.2015 passed by the learned Chief Court in Writ Petition No. 100/2014 is without jurisdiction, illegal and incompeten t as no writ petition lies against the non -statutory bodies/NGOs. 

He further submits that the case of the respondent falls under “Master and Servant” rules. 

He submits that the extra -ordinary writ jurisdiction can only be invoked against the statutory bodi es and government

3 institutions in case of any denial with regard to the fundamental rights of the citizens. 

He prays that the impugned judgment dated 31.03.2015 in Writ Petition No. 100/2014 passed by the learned Chief Court may graciously be set aside in circumstances. 4. 

On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent supports the impugned judgment dated 31.03.2015 in Writ Petition No. 100/2014 passed by the learned Chief Court. 

He contends that although the Aurat Foundation is an NGO but it is sponsored by the Government with the collaboration of Benazir Income Support Program (BISP). 

Per learned counsel writ lies in this case and the question of maintainability was raised by the petitioners in the learned Chief Court which w as also resolved by the learned Chief Court. 

He prays that the impugned judgment dated 31.03.2015 in Writ Petition No. 100/2014 passed by the learned Chief Court may pleased be maintained. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned judgment dated 31.03.2015 in Writ Petition No. 100/2014 passed by the learned Chief Court. 

Admittedly, the Aurat Foundation is a Non -Governmental Organization (NGO) and it is sett led principle of law that writ jurisdiction can not be invoked against any private organization. 

The case of the respondent falls under the principle of “Master and Servant” rules. 6. 

In view of the above discussions, we convert this petition into an app eal and the same is allowed. 

Consequently, the
