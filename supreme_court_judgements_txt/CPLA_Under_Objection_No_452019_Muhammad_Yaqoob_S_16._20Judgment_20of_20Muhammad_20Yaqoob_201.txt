Govt ) 2. 

Necessary fa cts g iving rise to the lis in hand are that in the month of December, 2014, respondent No. 3 advertised some posts of FC Drivers BPS-05 in Karakuram Security Force (KKSF) on contract basis to provide security for Chinese Nationals working on KKH from Raikot to Basari Check Post. 

In pursuance of the said advertisement, the petitioners applied for the sai d posts and after passing of test/ interview held on 06.01.2015, succeeded to secure appointment s against the respective posts on 16.01.2015. 

After appointment on contract basis against the posts, t he petitioners continued their services till 31.12.2015, when the respondent No. 3 verbally discontinued their services. 

The petitioners, after discontinuation of their services, filed a departmental appeal before the Inspector General of Police, GB (respondent No. 3 herein ) for regularization of their services, copy whereof was also endorsed to the Chief Minister GB. 

It appeared that upon receipt of this application, a resolution with regard to regularization of services of the petitioners was moved in the Gilgit -Baltistan Legislat ive Assembly. 

Consequent to the resolution, a special committee was constituted by the then Chief Minister Gilgit -Baltistan to resolve the matter in que stion, as such, the committee in order to resolve the issue, convened a meeting on 31.10.2016 wherein it recommended regularization of services of the petitioners in the same line as was done in the case of first batch of 437 FCs and subsequent batch of 22 Foot Constables. 

The said recommendations were sent to the respondent No. 3 for implementation, however, he failed to comply with the recommendations of the Special Committee apparently on the ground of non -availability of requisite posts with the Police Department, GB. 

The petitioners, being fed up with the stubborn behavior of the respondent No. 3 and in

============================================================
PAGE 3
============================================================

Page 3 of 11 (Muhammad Yaqoob & others Vs Prov. 

Govt ) order to get a writ issued to the respondents, knocked at the doors of the learned GB Chief Court by way of writ petition, however writ petit ion filed by the petitioners before the learned Chief Court met the fate of dismissal holding it to be meritless, which has now been assailed before this Court through the CPLA in hand. 3. 

The learned counsel for the petitioners contended that the petitioners were initially appointed on 16.01.2015 as FC Drivers BP -5 in KKSF on contract basis after fulfilling all codal formalities i.e advertisement of posts, conducting test/interview. 

He next contended that respondent No. 3 regularized services of 43 7 other contract employees among st them, 22 employees were those whose appointments was made without observing the codal formalities i.e. advertisement, test/interview, even then, their services were regularized. 

He next added that w hen the petitioners fil ed departmental appeal before the competent authority seeking regularization of their services in the same manner as of their counterparts whose services were regularized earlier, the respondent No. 3 did not consider their departmental appeal which was a case of clear discrimination. 

He next argued that the case of regularization of the petitioners was also taken up in the GB Legislative Assembly whereon a committee was constituted for the pur pose of resolution of the issue. 

He maintained that the co mmittee after convening its meeting held on 31.10.2016 recommended regularization of services of the petitioners subject to availability of posts in GB Police Department in BPS -5 but respondent No. 3 did not bother to honor the recommendations passed by th e Special Committee which is clear violation of recommendations of executive authority. 

The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that one of the colleagues of the petitioner s, namely Mir Iqbal

============================================================
PAGE 4
============================================================

Page 4 of 11 (Muhammad Yaqoob & others Vs Prov. 

Govt ) who was initially appointed as Cook BPS -1 on contract basis along with the petitioners and a similarly placed person, was regularized by respondent No. 3 as Foot Constable BPS -5. 

But to the extent of the present petitioners, the respondent No. 3 was reluctant, as such, this action on the part of the respondent No. 3 was a clear discrimination with the petitioners which was against the Law /Rule and natural justice (However no document was produced by the learned counsel for the petitioner in support of his claim of regularization of one similarly placed person, namely Mir Iqbal). 

The learned counsel for the petitioners went on to argue that since the learned GB Chief Court failed to exe rcise its judicious mind to take into consideration all material facts and legal aspects of the case, hence, the impugned judgment so passed by the learned Chief Court is liable to be set aside. 4. 

On the other hand, the learned Advocate General Gilgit -Baltistan argued that the impugned judgment passed by the learned GB Chief Court is in accordance with law and facts. 

He next argued that the petitio ners could not claim regularization as their initial appointments were made purely on contract basis for provision of security to Chinese Nationals working on KKH from Raikote Bridge to Basari Check post and as such, their services were terminated in pursuance of the letter issued by the General Manager, NHA vide No. 1(58)/GM (NAs )/NHA/Abtd: /15/885 dated 31st December, 2015. 

He further argued that during the process of recruitment, it was clearly mentioned in the advertisement that the appointments were purely on contract basis and were liable to be terminated without assigning any reason and without any notice on completion of project period or on expiry of contract agreement dated 29th October, 2014 signed between GM NHA, Abbottabad and GB Police. 

As to the

============================================================
PAGE 5
============================================================

Page 5 of 11 (Muhammad Yaqoob & others Vs Prov. 

Govt ) contention s of learned counsel for the petitioners regarding noncomplianc e of Special Committee ’s recommendations, the learned Advocate General Gilgit -Baltistan contended that the Committee constituted for that purpose clearly recommended regularization of services of the petitioners subject to availability of posts, however at the relevant time, the requisite posts were not available with the Police Department GB. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsel for both the parties. 

The r ecord a s well as impugned judgment perused. 6. 

Admittedly, vide office order No. 

SP.KKSF -215-14 dated 16th January, 2015, appointments of petitioners as FC Drivers BPS -5 on contract basis were made after observing the procedure prescribed under the relevant law/ rules. 

There is no denial to this effect by the learned Advocate General, GB also. 

It is also an admitted fact that services of the petitioners were terminated without issuing any proper order in writing rather the same was done verbally. 

There is no denial of the factum of submission of departmental appeal by the petitioners for regularizatio n of their services in line with other 437 Foot-Constables whose appointments in Karakorum Security Force (KKSF) were also made initially on contract basis and subsequently their contractual services were brought on regular side. 

In order to strengthen the factum of regularization of these 437 Foot Constables (FCs), we deem it appropriate to reproduce the relevant lines from the regularization order(s) of 437 FCs as under: “OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE, GILGIT -BALTISTAN, GILGIT No. 

IGP -1(2)AP -E-V/9105 -9107/2019 Dated 8th August, 2019

============================================================

============================================================

Page 6 of 11 (Muhammad Yaqoob & others Vs Prov. 

Govt ) OFFICE ORDER: In pursuance of Finance Division(Regulation Wing) Islamabad Office Memorandum No. 7 (9)R-1/2012 dated 31.05.2013 tilted “Protection of contract employees on regularization/ appointments on regular basis” the competent authority has been pleased to grant pay protection with effect from the first appointment basis in respect of following FCs and FC/ Drivers who were initially appointed in KKSF on contact basis and later on have been regularized against newly created posts of KKSF”. (Underlines supplied) 7. 

In addition to regularization of above 437 contract FCs, the file contains anothe r Office Order whereby 22 contractual employees of KKSF were regularized. 

For ease of reference, we quote below the said office order: “INSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE GILGIT -BALTISTAN, GILGIT No. 

IGP -1(2)/657 -60/2015 Dated 3rd March, 2015 OFFICE ORDER: In pursuance of Gilgit -Baltistan Cabinet Decisions taken in its meeting dated 19.02.2014 and 10.09.2014 the Inspector General Gilgit -Baltistan has been pleased to approve regularization of services of the following 22 contractual employees of Gilgit - Baltis tan Police (KKSF) against clear vacancies with effect from 1.2015” (Underlines supplied) The last few lines extracted from the above Office Order depicts that those 437 and subsequent 22 FCs were initially appointed on contract basis and subsequently the ir services were regularized against the newly created posts. 

In view of this situation, it can safely be held that these two set s of FCs were appointed in KKSF; in the case of first set of FCs, their contractual services were regularized on creation of new posts

============================================================
PAGE 7
============================================================

Page 7 of 11 (Muhammad Yaqoob & others Vs Prov. 

Govt ) while the latter set of FCs/ Drive rs (now petitioners in the present case) were no t regularized for want of posts. 

In addition to this, it is also an admitted fact that Gilgit - Baltistan Legislative Assembly (GBLA), which is a legislating forum /house for the citizens of Gilgit -Baltistan and the implementation of its decisions/ recommendations are de rigueur for public functionaries of Administration branch of government. 

The GBLA, recommended, rather directed the respondent No. 3 (Inspector Gene ral of Police) GB for regularization of services of the petitioners on availability of posts. 

However, at the relevant time, for want of vacant posts, the recommendations/ directions of the Committee could not be implemented. 

For the sake of brevity and co nvenience, the composition of Committee and its recommendations are reproduced as under: “(i) Muhammad Ibrahim Sanai, Minister Education/Chairman Special Committee (ii) Mr. 

Jafaru llah Khan, Deputy Speaker (iii) Mr. 

Aurangzeb Khan, Par. 

Secretary Law (iv) Mr. 

Rizwan Ali, Member GBLA (v) Mr. 

Ghulam Hussain, Member GBLA The special committee after convening meeting held on 31st October, 2016, made their recommendation s which are reproduced herein below: “1) The Chairman of the Committee pointed out that all the employees must be treated equally. 

He further added that those employees who meet all the prescribed codal formalities i.e who had been inducted through proper test/ interview and got trained from police Recruitment training center shall be regularize d at the earliest. 2) The forum unanimously recommended that since 437 personnel were regularized in Phase -I and Phase -II and 22 more constables were regularized vide office order No. 

IGP -1(2)/657 -60/2015 dated 03.03.2015, thus remaining 10 Nos of security FC Personnel shall also be regularized in BPS -05. 3) The forum further recommended that as the above 10 Nos. of FC security personnel had been inducted purely on merit basis after being appeared in test/interview and training

Govt ) sessions at PRTC Gilgit -Baltistan thus their services shall be regularized subject to immediate availability of vacant posts in Gilgit -Baltistan Police Department in BPS -05 provided that the said employees should be exempted from the test/interview as they had gone through the proce ss already” In furtherance to above and with regard to conclusive nature of decisions of the Cabinet /public functionaries, we would like to borrow some support from a judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan titled Pir Imran Sajid Vs Managing Director/General Manager (Manager Finance) Telephone Industries of Pakistan 2015 SCMR 1257. 

The relevant paragraph is reproduced as follows: “8.In addition to the benefit of the above dictum, we may observe here that TIP's non - compliance, rather defiance of the decision of the cabinet sub -committee to regularize the services of the appellants, and not heeding to the directive of their Ministry to comply with said decision, compliance whereof is being sought by the appellants, is wholly illegal and mala fide ” 8. 

The respondent s’ reluctance to regularize services of the petitioners on the pretext of non-availability of requisite posts came to an end now because, as per an Office Note put up by officials of Police Department, GB that as many as 267 posts in the rank of FC (BS-07) are lying vacant with Police Department GB. 

This factum of availability of posts is further strengthened by a letter dated 23rd September, 2020 of AIG Establishment addressed to the Chief Election Commissioner, which is reproduced herein below: OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE GILGIT -BALTISTAN GILGIT To, The Chief Election Commissioner Gilgit -Baltistan, Gilgit

Page 9 of 11 (Muhammad Yaqoob & others Vs Prov. 

Govt ) No.IGP -1(2)AP -E-V/14587 -89/2020 Dated the 23rd Sept,2020 Subject: NOC FOR RECRUITMENT GAINST THE VACANT POSTS OF ASIPS & FCS IN POLICE DEPARTMENT GILGIT -BALTISTAN Please refer to the subject cited above 2. …………… ………………………………………. 3. 

Beside 267 posts Foot Constables are also vacant in various Districts/Units, which impede smooth working of Police in prevention of crimes and maintenance law & order. 

The service of above strength if recruited timely can also be utilized in smooth o f conduct of fort hcoming Gilgit -Baltistan General Elections 2020. 4. 

Therefore, it is requested that NOC for recruitment against the vacant posts of ASIs and FCs may kindly be granted to enable this office to complete recruitment of ASIs and FCs well in time. 

The DIG Establishment appearing on Court ’s notice on behalf of Inspector General of Police, GB and the learned Advocate General, GB also confirmed at bar the availability of 267 posts in GB Police Department. 9. 

Now we would consider it apt to advert to the aspect of experience. 

Being a disciplined force, relevant experience and trainings are essentially required for achieving better performance by the personnel of the force. 

New recruits as compared to the experienced and trained ones can cost government exc hequer in terms of time and money. 

Reference is also made to a judgment of this Court in the case titled Provincial Government of GB through Chief Secretary Vs. 

Manzoor Ahmed (CPLA under Objection No. 40/2020) wherein it has been held as under: “4.The second aspect of the case is the experience. 

Experience is more often than not a prerequisite

============================================================
PAGE 10
============================================================

Page 10 of 11 (Muhammad Yaqoob & others Vs Prov. 

Govt ) attached to a post(s) for all the new recruitments. 

The appointees on contracts, who worked against a particular post in a government service for whatever period, acquire knowledge and experience of the posts held by them on contract; as such they can produce better result and services than the new appointees. 

However, it has to be seen that initial appointments of such contractual appointees have been made in acco rdance with the method prescribed under the relevant law/ rules inasmuch as such appointments were urgently required to cater for the genuine requirements of the concerned departments”. 

We further observe that besides losing trained manpower by the Police Department GB, it would also not be in the interest of the respondents to undergo another expensive exercise of new recruitments which may cost huge amount. 

With a view to forty the abov e observations, we lend support from a judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as 2017 PLC (C.S) 397. 

The relevant lines are reproduced below: “Fresh recruitment by the Bank in place of the respondents was also against the interest of t he Bank as the same would be an expensive exercise in terms of time, money and effort” 10. 

In view of our observations and coming to the factual as well as legal position explained herein above, we convert the above CPLA No. 45/2019 into an appeal and the same is allowed. 

The impugned judgment dated 27.09.2019, passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court in Writ Petition No. 79/2018 is set aside. 

Consequently, the respondents are directed to regularize the services of t he petitioners from the date of passing of our short order dated 19.11.2020. 

The intervening period between termination of contractual services of the petitioner and subsequent regularization shall be treated as leave without pay. 

The

============================================================

Page 11 of 11 (Muhammad Yaqoob & others Vs Prov. 

Govt ) above were the reason s for our short order dated 19.11.2020 which is reproduced herein below: “The learned counsel for the respective parties have been heard. 

We have also gone through the record of the case as well as the impugned judgment. 

Although, the learned Advocate General, Gilgit - Baltistan argued the case vigorously, however, in view of the facts and grounds prevailing with the case in hand, we are not persuaded by his submissions. 

Therefore, for the reasons to be recorded later, we convert the above CPLA under Objection No. 45/2019 into an appeal and the same is allowed. 2. 

The respondents are directed to appoint the petitioners out of the 267 vacant posts against the respective cadres previously held by them. 

The appointments shall be made “with immediate effect”, while the intervening period between termination of their services and subsequent appointments shall be treated as leave without pay”.
