Upon hearing, the said suit was dismissed vide judgment dated 29.09.2012 declaring the disputed lan d as Khalisa Sarkar. 

The judgment of the learned trial Court was upheld up to the learned Chief Court. 

The petitioners being aggrieved filed this petition for leave to appeal for setting aside the concurrent findings of the learned three Courts below. 3. 

The learned counsel for the petitioners sub mits that the petitioner is in possession of the disputed land since 1965 and the land in question was given to him by the then Raja Gupis in return of his services. 

The adjacent land belongs to the then Raja wh ich is in possession of his sons. 

He also submits that the petitioners have made huge development in land in question by planting trees etc. 

Per learned counsel District Ghizer is an unsettled area and there is no Khalisa land thereat Ghizer, hence, the findings of the Courts below are the misinterpretation of law and facts of the case. 

He submits that although there are three concurrent findings of the Courts be low yet all the Courts fell in error while passing the impugned judgments/orders. 

He prays that the impugned judgment dated 20.11.2015 in Civil Revision No. 60/2015 passed by the learned Chief Court may graciously be set aside. 4.

3 Revision No. 60/2015 passed by the learned Chief Court. 

He contends that the petitioners failed to produce an iota of evidence in support of his claim. 

He also contends that the learned counsel for the petitioner himself conceeded in the learned Chief Court that the land is Khalisa Sarkar. 

He further contends that the Courts below have rightly dismissed the appeal of the petitioner while passing the impugned judgments/or ders, hence, no indulgence is warranted into its by this court. 

He prays that the impugned judgment dated 20.11.2015 in Civil Revision No. 60/2015 passed by the learned Chief Court may pleased be maintained. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the r espective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned judgment dated 20.11.2015 in Civil Revision No. 60/2015 passed by the learned Chief Court and the concurrent findings of the learned Courts below. 

The perusal of the record transpires that the petitioner failed either to produce any evidence with regard to the allotment or the gift deed so affected by the then Raja as per his claim regarding the said land in his favour mere possession of the land does not create right of ownership. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner also could not point out any illegality & infirmity in the impugned judgment dated 20.11.2015 in Civil Revision No. 60/2015 passed by the learned Chief Court. 6. 

In view of the above, we convert th is petition into an appeal and the same is dismissed.
