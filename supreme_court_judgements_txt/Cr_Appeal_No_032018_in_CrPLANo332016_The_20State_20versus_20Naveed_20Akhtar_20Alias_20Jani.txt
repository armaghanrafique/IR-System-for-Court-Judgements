4 judgment dated 20.08.2014. 

The operative part of the said judgment is hereby reproduced as under: - “Quote: - In the light of the above discussion, I hold that the prosecution has proved guilt of accused of accused Naveed Akhtar alias Jani for the murder of deceased Javed Hussain, hence, I convict accused Naveed Akhtar alias Jani under section 302(b) PPC read with section 7(a) of the Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997 and sentenced him to death.

The learned Advocate General appearing on behalf of the State and Mr.

============================================================

5 evidence to pro ve the case against the respondent beyond the shadow of doubt. 

Per learned counsels, the respondent did not produce any witnesses in support of his defence rather he tried to shift the act of murder on one Shahzad alias Nomi. 

They reiterate that the dying declaration of deceased, circumstantial evidence, confessional statement of respondent, medical evid ence and the abscondance of accused are the corroborative piece of evidence which connects the respondent with commission of offence of murder. 

They further submit that PW -01 and PW -02 corroborated each other and their evidence has not be shattered in thei r cross - examination. 

They add that there was no enmity between the deceased and accused party prior to the commission of the alleged offence rather he was murdered due to sectarian terrorism. 

They submit that the prosecution has successfully proved its cas e against the respondent beyond reasonable doubt s. 

In support of dying declar ation they relied upon the case laws reported as 2001 SCMR 1474 and PLD 2005 Peshawar 172. 

Per learned counsels, the impugned judgment dated 19.05.2016 in Cr. 

Appeal No. 25/2014 is the result of misreading and non -appreciation of prosecution evidence and other materials on record. 

They contend that the judgment dated 20.08.2014 passed by the learned Anti-Terrorism Court No. 1, at Gilgit is well reasoned and well founded. 

They pr ay that the conviction/sentences awarded by the learned Trial Court vide judgment dated 20.08.2014 may graciously be maintained and

6 the impugned judgment, passed by the learned Chief Court be set aside being not sustainable. 8. 

On the other hand, Mr. 

Jaha nzaib Khan learned counsel for the respondent supports the impugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court. 

He contends that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the respondent, hence, the judgment dated 20.08.2014 passed by the l earned Anti -Terrorism Court is against the basic principles of law & criminal justice system. 

He also contends that the conviction/sentences awarded to the respondent have been totally based on highly interested, untrustworthy and incredible witnesses. 

Per learned counsel, no incriminating articles have been recovered from the possession or on pointation of the respondent. 

The medical report totally negates the whole prosecution story/version and the learned Trial Court failed to extend the be nefit of doubts to the respondent. 

He reiterates that the most important piece of evidence i.e. 

P ost Mortem Report/Medico Legal Report is totally contra and negates the whole prosecution versions. 

The depositions of so called prosecution witnesses are not inspiring confidence. 

Instead of quality, quantity of evidence has been considered which is not tenable in law. 

He contends that there is no eye witness of the alleged occurrence and no direct evidence and cogent evidence available on record again st the respondent. 

The Prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against the respondents beyond reasonable doubts. 

He reiterates that the learned Trial Court fell in

7 error by convicting the respondent which was rightly set aside by the learned Chi ef Court vide impugned judgment. 

He prays that the impugned judgment dated 19.05.2016 passed by the learned Chief Court may pleased be maintained. 9. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record a nd gone through the impugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court as well as the judgment dated 20.08.2014 in TC -03/2013 passed by the learned Anti -Terrorism Court No. 1, at Gilgit and the case laws cited by the learned counsel of the complainant. 

The careful perusal of prosecution evidence & other material on record, the learned Anti - Terrorism Court has rightly convicted the respondent. 

The respondent has brutally murdered the deceased namely Javed Hussain. 

The long absconsion of the respondent, extra-judicial confession of the respondent, and dying declaration made by the deceased before the Pw -01 namely Muhammadi the father of deceased and and corroborated by PW-02 namely SIP Naseem Hussain, circumstantial evidence, medical evidence and recovery o f two empty shells of 9mm from the place of occurrence on pointation of respondent was sufficient material to prove the case against the respondent beyond any shadow of doubt. 

The case laws referred by the learned Advocates for the complainant are applicab le. 10. 

In view of the above discussions, we converted this petition into an appeal and the same was allowed by our short order dated 05.04.2018. 

The judgment dated 20.08.2014 in TC -03/2013
