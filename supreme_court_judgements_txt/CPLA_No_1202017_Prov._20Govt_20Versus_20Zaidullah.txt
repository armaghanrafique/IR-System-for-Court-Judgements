The learned Advocate General submits that the respondent was initially appointed as teacher BPS -09 in High School Oshikandas Gilgit but the he directly approached Home & Services Department on the basis of qualification of FA/CT. 

He also submits that the Home and Services Department without takin g into consideration the fact that there were already many other senior teachers waiting for promotion in the next Grade of BPS -14, promoted the respondent in BPS -14 which was irregular and unjustified. 

Per learned Advocate General, the respondent was much junior and he had no vested right of promotion to BPS -14 by passing senior eligible teachers. 

He submits that the respondent due to ante date promotion claimed further promotion in BPS -16 resultantly he was granted promotion in BPS -16 with effect from 19.05.2000. 

This promotion was issued without financial back benefits due to the said pre -mature and illegal promotion order of Services Department. 

He submits that the learned Chief Court fell in error while accepting the Writ Petition of the respondent vid e impugned judgment dated 02.10.2012. 

He submits that the said impugned judgment is the result of misreading/non -reading of the facts of the case and the same is not sustainable. 

He prays that the said impugned judgment may graciously be set aside. 4.

4 petition filed by the respon dent vide impugned judgment dated 02.10.2012. 

He prays that the said impugned judgment may pleased be maintained being well reasoned and well founded. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the material on reco rd and gone through the impugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court. 

Admittedly, the petitioners have discriminated the respondent by depriving him from his legal right of promotion on the pretext of Audit restrictions. 

The respondent may be treated equally among equals and he h as right to claim the ante date seniority. 

In our considered view, the impugned judgment dated 02.10.2012 passed by the learned Chief Court is well reasoned and well founded, hence, no interference into it is warran ted. 6. 

In view of the above discussions, we convert this petition into an appeal and the same is dismissed. 

Consequently, the impugned judgment dated 02.10.2012 in Writ Petition No. 43/2009 passed by the learned Chief Court is affirmed. 7. 

The appeal i s dismissed in above terms.
