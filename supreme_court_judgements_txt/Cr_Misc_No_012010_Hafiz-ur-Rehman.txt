The brief facts leading to the present petitioner s are that one Muhammed Zareel R/O District Astore lodged an FIR with police station Astore alleging ther ein tha t on receiving information about murder of h is real uncle Muhammad Kabi l, he rushed to place of occurrence where he found that some other people had also gathered thereon. 

On his inquiry he was informe d that his uncle deceased Muhammad Kabil who was working as road cooli had proceed ed to place of his duty along with Sohail Ahmed S/O Muhammad Ayoub, Sohail S/O Akbar Ali and Mir Ghazi R/O Mouza Dashkin Astore when the deceased and his companions reached t he place of occurrence at about 8 A.M some unknown assailant /assailants hit the deceased at the back side of his head with fire Arms, resultantly he died at the spot. 

The motive alleged by compliant in the FIR is that about 8 months prior to the occurrence, sister of co -accused Zahid Hussain had eloped with one Tahir and later on entered into marriage the complainant suspected that the deceased had facilitate d this elopement. 2.

The petitioner and co -accused moved their bail application before Additional District & Sessions Judge Astore, who vide order dated 16 -12-2009 allowed bail petition of one of co -accused namely Uma r Rahman and dismissed bail application qua present petitioner and Zahid Hussain. 

The petitioner and co -accused Zahid Hussain having been declined their bail application, filed application for bail before the learned Chief Court Gilgit Baltistan which came to be heard by Raja Jalal -ud-Din, Chief Judge Chie f Court Gilgit Baltistan who vide impugned order rejected the same to the extent of present petitioner and granted bail infavour of co -accused namely Zahid Hussain. 4. 

The learned counsel for petitioner contended that the petitioner is innocent and case a gainst petitioner is based absolutely on false and baseless allegations, that there is no tangible evidence against the petitioner and both the co -accused have been enlarged on bail as such the present petitioner is also entitled for grant of bail as per r ule of consistency. 

He further submitted that the alleged recovery of weapon of offence is of no value as the same has been recovered on joint pointation of present petitioner and his co -accused who has already been enlarged on bail. 5. 

The learned Advoc ate General on the other hand while Strenuously opposing the petition stressed that the petitioner is

============================================================

4 directly charged in the prompt ly lodged FIR, that the weapo n of offence has been recovered on his pointation and the prosecution has successfully esta blished a prima facie case against the petitioner as such he is not entitled for concession of bail. 6. 

We have carefully attended to the arguments of learned counsel for both sides at length and have perused the available material with due care and caut ion and have also gone through the impugned judgment, from perusal of the record it transpires that no doubt the offence has been commit ted in brought day light, name of the petitioner is also mentioned in the FIR lodged by Muhammad Zareel as a suspect, re covery of weapon of offence is also allegedly made on the pointation of petitioner but from tentative assessment of the material available on record there is no direct evidence to connect the petitioner with the present crime, three accused namely Zahid Hu ssain S/O Muhammad Zaman, Hafiz -ur-Rahman S/O Ibadat Kha n, the present petitioner and Imranul Haque S/O Muhammad Ayoub have been nominated in the FIR as suspects and the star witness of the occurrence namely So hail Ahmed S/O Muhammad Ayoub, the brother in law of deceased who was also mentioned as a witness of the occurrence by FIR lodger states in his statement Under Section 161 Cr.P.C. to have seen one Imranul Haque holding a Pistol in his hand, the said Umarul Haque has already been released on bail by l earned additional Sessions Judge Astore, vide order dated 16-12-2009. 

The said witness was also produced as PW 2 before the trial court on

5 16-12-2009 where he categorically denied to have seen any person firing at the deceased. 7. 

It is the case of prosecution that when the PW Sohail soon after the firing at the deceased saw one Imran -ul-Haque S/O Muhammad Ayoub holding a pistol in his hand at the place of occurrence but the prosecution has neither recovered any pistol from him nor he has been figur ed in challan, rather the recovery of the pistol has been shown to have been effected on the pointation of p etitioner and other co - accused Umarul Rehman S/O Amirullah. 

It is also stated that there is no fire arms export report with the prosecution to ascer tain whether the fire has been made by the pisto l recovered from petitioner or not. 8. 

Whatever discussed above the case against the petitioner calls for further inquiry into his guilt within the purview of Section 497 (2) Cr.P.C. 

This petition is theref ore, converted into appeal and allowed. 

However, our above observation s are purely tentative in na ture and the trial court shall proceed with the case un -influenced by this order. 

Our shot order by virtue of which the petitioner was allowed bail reproduc ed herein under is treated as part of this order. “For the reasons to be recorded separately, this petition is converted into appeal and allowed. 

The appellant is directed to be released on bail subject to furnishing of bail bonds in the sum of Rs. 

One Lac only (100,000) with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of trial court ”.
