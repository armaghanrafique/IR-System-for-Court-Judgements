He further submits that on the other hand, the respondent is claiming that the plot No. 154 was allotted to one Subedar Major Hassan resident of Katpanah through a gift deed in his favor who was stranger. 

He contends that no plot can be transferred and possession thereto be given without the permis sion of Head Quarter Northern Light Infantry. 

The respondent filed Civil Suit No. 29/2012 before the learned Civil Judge Skardu for declaration and possession with the contention that the plaintiff is the owner of the suit property. 

Upon hearing, the learn ed Civil Judge Skardu vide judgment dated 27.09.2014 decreed the suit property in favor of plaintiff/respondent who were stranger. 

The petitioner being aggrieved challenged the said judgment before the learned Additional District Judge Skardu in CFA No. 46 /2014. 

Wherein, the lea rned Addit ional District Judge Skardu revers ed the impugned judgment and decreed the appeal of the petitioner through judgment dated 10.12.2014 in CFA No. 46/2014. 

The respondent feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the said impug ned judgment filed CSA No. 11/2014 before the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court. 

Upon hearing, the learned Gilgit - Baltistan Chief Court vide its judgment dated 27.10.2015 accepted the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment passed by the learned District Judge, hence, this petition for leave to appeal for setting aside the impugned judgment as well as the judgment passed by the learned Trial Court Skardu. 

He further submits that the judgment of the learned District Court was based on facts and

============================================================

============================================================

5 law whereas the impugned judgment dated 27.10.2015 passed by the Chief Court and judgment dated 10.04.2014 of the learned Civil Judge Skardu were the result of non-reading and misr eading of the facts of the case and implication of misconception of law hence, the same are require d to be set aside. 5. 

On the other hand the learned counsel for the respondent supports the impugned judgment dated 27.10.2015 passed by the learned Chief Court and the judgment passed by the Trial Court being well reasoned are sustainable. 

No interference is warranted thereto. 

The judgment passed by the lea rned Additional District Judge Skardu was not tenable and liable to set a side. 6. 

We have heard both the learned counsels for respective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the judgment s of the courts below as well as allotment Order No. 258/4/MC/Property -5. 

Admittedly, the plot No. 173 was allotted by NLI Regiment Center Bonji to the petitioner ’s father on 28.12.1991. 

The mutation of the said plot attested on 11.03.1991 and the possession of same was given to him by 62 Brigade. 

The said plot is in the possession of the petitioner who has constructed a residential house over this plot after demarcation made/possession given by the Head Quarter 62 B rigade. 7. 

In view of the above discussion, in our considered view the impugned judgment dated 27.10.2015 in CSA No. 11/2014 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court is not well

============================================================

6 founded and the judgment dated 10.12.2014 in CFA No. 46/2014 passed by the learned District Judge Skardu is well reasoned and in accordance with facts and law. 

Consequently, we convert ed this petition into an appeal and the same was allowed vide o ur short order dated 26.04.2016. 

The impugned judgment dated 27.10.2015 in CSA No. 11/2014 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Chief Court as well as the judgment dated 27.09.2016 in Civil Suit No. 29/2012 passed by the Civil Judge 1st Class Skardu are set aside. 

Whereas, the judgment dated 10.12.2014 in CFA No. 46/2014 passed by the learned Additional District Judge Skardu is maintained. 

These were the reasons for our said short order. 8. 

The app eal is allowed.
