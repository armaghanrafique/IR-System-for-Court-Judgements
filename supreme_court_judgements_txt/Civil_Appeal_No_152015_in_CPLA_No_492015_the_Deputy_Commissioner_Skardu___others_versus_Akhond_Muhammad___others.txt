JUDGMENT. 

Dr. 

Rana Muhammad Shamim, CJ….. 

This petition for leave to appeal has been arisen out of the impugned judgment/Order dated 08.11.2004 in SMC. 

No. 01/2014 passed by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan whereby the appl ication filed by the respondent was accepted and the petitioner s were directed to bear the expenditure amounting to Rs. 300,000/ - (rupees three lac) only incurred during the recovery of the dead bodies by each legal heir s of the deceased which they paid to the Rock Rafters, Helpers and Drivers. 

The remaining operative part of the impugned judgment is hereby reproduced as under: - i. “The District Administration is directed to establish fully equipped rescue staff for rescue in such like incidence. ii. 

The in charge traffic police and SP licensing Authority is directed to carry out the verification of valid driving license of drivers employed with public transport vehicles as well as school and college (s) vehicles. iii. the private school owners are directed not t o employee any person (s) as driver having less than five years experience for playing buses couches and Vans holding the license of HTV (Heavy Transport Vehicle) in future. iv.

The authorities of PWD are also directed not to use the roads for installment of electric polls and water channels etc without prior written permission from the department concerned and land owners. vii. 

Excise and Taxation officers are directed to carry out the fitness of the school/couches /Vans as well as public transport on monthly basis and report be submitted to concern Deputy Commissioner with the intimation. viii. 

Principal/Administration of Al -Zahra College is directed to furnish detail of their vehicles with certified copies of CNIC and driving licenses of drivers to the Deputy Commissioner Skardu within 10 days ”. 2. 

The learned Advocate General Gilgit -Baltistan submits that the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 71 of “The Gilgit -Baltista n (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009” was not supposed to enter into the realm of factual controversy and give any opinion/verdict thereto. 

He maintained that under no circumstances the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan could meddle with the af fairs in which an adequate and efficacious remedy can be had from the Court below. 

He also submits that “Article 71 of The Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009”, does not provide to the Chief Court to exercise of Suo Motu jurisdicti on and an order passed in exercise of such jurisdiction shall be corrum -non-judice. 

While saying so he relied upon the judgment the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case of Dr. 

Imran Khattak and others versus Ms. 

Sofia Waqas Khattak & others, reported as 2014, SCMR, Page 122, and the judgment of this court in case

No. 86/2014, The Secretary Works Gilgit -Baltistan & three (03) others versus Talib Shah & thirty Five (35) others. 3. 

On the other hand, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents supports the impugned Judgment and argued that the learned Chief Court on getting information about infringement of any fundamental right was well within its rights to step in and pass an appropriate order. 

He contends that whe re fundamentals rights of the citizens are trampled over, the Chief Court can exercise of its Suo Motu Jurisdiction. 

He finally submits that the learned Chief Court, Gilgit -Baltistan has rightly taken cognizance of the matter and passed an appropriate orde r redressing the grievances of the persons aggrieved. 4. 

We have heard the learned Counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the materials placed on record and gone through the impugned Judgment. 

The question arises as to whether Article 71 of The Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009 read with Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, expressly or by implication, provides for exercise of Suo Motu Jurisdiction or not by the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan. 

The case laws cited by the learned Advocate General are applicable. 

For convenience we hereby reproduced both the articles i.e. 

Article 71 of “The Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self Governance) Order, 2009”, and “Article 199 of the Constitution of Islami c Republic of Pakistan 1973” as under: -Under Article 71:- Jurisdiction of Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan:-

============================================================

The Government, exercising any power or performing any function in, or in relation to, Gilgit -Baltistan as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the fundamentals r ights c onferred by this order. 

On the application of any aggrieved party, make an order. (i).

Where:- (a). an application is made to the Chief Court for an order under sub clause (a) or sub -clause (c) of clause (2); and (b).

(4A) An interim order made by a High Court on an application made to it to question the validity or legal effe4ct of any order made, proceeding taken or act done by any authority or person, which has been made, taken o r done or purpor ts to have been made, taken or done under any law which is specified in part 1 of the First Schedule or relates to, or is connected with, State property or assessment or collection of public revenues shall cease to have effect on the expir ation of a period of six months following the day on which it is made: Provided that the matter shall be finally decided by the High Court within six months from the date on which the interim order is made.

The careful perusal of both the articles reproduced herein above and the parameter laid down in case of Dr. 

Imran Khattak and others versus Ms. 

Sofia Waqas Khattak & others supra would show that the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan & High Courts of Pakistan would exercise its extraordinary discretionary / constitutional Jurisdiction where it is satisfied that, subject to the constitution, no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of a person whether aggrieved or not on an information or on its own knowledge. 6. 

In view of the above discussion we hold that the learned Chief Court Gilgit -Baltistan cannot exercise Suo Motu Jurisdiction under Article 71 of Gilgit -Baltistan (Empowerment & Self - Governance) Order, 2009. 

Consequently, we converted this petition into an appeal and the same wa s allowed vide our short order dated 26.04.2016. 

The respondents, if, aggrieved may approach the proper forum /Court Of Law for redressal of their grievances. 

These were the reasons of our said short order. 7. 

The appeal is allowed.
