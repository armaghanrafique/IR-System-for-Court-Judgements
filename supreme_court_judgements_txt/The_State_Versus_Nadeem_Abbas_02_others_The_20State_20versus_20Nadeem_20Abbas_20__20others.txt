The said SIP Faqeer Muhammad stated that on 13.05.2011 at about 0605 hours on information received from the DHQ Hospital that one Shabana Akhtar D/O Doulat Ali resident of Chonga Astore, who was under trainee Nu rse committed the suicide by hang ing herself with the ceiling fan of Dining Hall of th e Hostel. 

The said SIP arrived at DHQ Hospital and carried out the proceedings under Section 174 Cr. 

PC. 

During the recording of the statements of witnesses, the suicide of the accused was found suspicious by the said SIP who accordingly sought permission from Judicial Magistrate Gilgit to further probe into the case. 

Consequently, he proceeded under Section 156 Cr.PC. 

During the said proceedings it was revealed by accused Nadeem Abbas son of Ghulam Abbas r/o Barmas that one Syed Jarar Hussain son of Syed Asghar Shah r/o Amphary, Ishfaq Hussain son of Muhammad Sharif and Shafqat son of Jaffar Ali r/o Henzal have sent illicit messages on the mobile of deceased Shabana Akhtar and threatened her for disclosing/playing her videos in whole of the hos pital.

Dilshad Begum & Dr. 

Wazir Muhammad were acquitted. 

The operative part of the said judgment is hereby reproduced as under: - “Quote ” Para -108. in view of the discussions made in paras No. 95 to 98 above, the prosecution has failed to establish the guilt of accused Doctor Dilshad Begum and accused Doctor Wazir Muhammad in the instant case. 

Prosecution evidence is quite insufficient to convict the above named accused. 

Hence, keeping in view the insufficient evidence, accused Doctor Dilshad Begum and accused Doctor Wazir Muhammad are hereby acquitted from the charges leveled against them in the instant case. 

The bail bonds of the said accused are al so hereby discharged. 

Para -109. 

In view of the above discussions made in paras No. 17 to 94 and paras No. 90 to 107, my findings against accused Nadeem Abbas, accused Jamila Bibi and accused Ijlal Hussain are as under: - (i) after evaluation of the entire evidence of prosecution, I am of the considered opinion that prosecution has proved its case against accused Nadeem Abbas, accused Jamila Bibi and accused Ijlal Hussain beyond any shadow of doubt by providing sufficient evidence in the shape of confessiona l statements of the above named three accused, Extra Judicial Confession of accused Nadeem Abbas, recovery of Pillow, CD Ex.P1 and call and messages record. (ii) No mitigating circumstances are available in favour of the accused Nadeem Abbas, accused Jamil a Bibi as they have put the Pillow on the mouth of deceased Shabana Akhtar in furtherance of their common intention. 

The manner in which the accused have committed the murder of deceased Shabana Akhtar, who was under trainee nurse, does not call for any le niency in the sentence. (ii) in the light of the above discussion, I hold that the prosecution has proved guilt of accused Nadeem Abbas, accused Jamila Bibi for murder of deceased Shabana Akhtar in furtherance of their common

The learned Advocate General submits that although the occurrence is unseen as there is no eye witness yet it based upon extra judicial confession, confession of the accused, corroborative circumstantial evidence, corroborative medical evidence, Recoveries on the pointation of the respondents and other material on record which connect the respondents with the commission of planned murder of Shabana Akhtar. 

He also submits that the respondents have admitted their guilt voluntarily recorde d under Section 21-H of

============================================================
PAGE 8
============================================================

8 the Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997. 

Per learned Advocate General, respondents have pointed out the place of occurrence in presence of Magistrate. 

On the pointation of accused Jamila Bibi, the Investiga tion Officer (I.O) has taken in to his possession one pillow and the said pillow has identified by accused Nadeem Abbas which was used by him to commit the murder of deceased Shabana Akhtar. 

The respondents have also indentified the Dopatta which was used by the accused for hanging the dead bo dy of deceased on ceiling fan of the Dining hall. 

He submits that on the directions of this apex court the Government of Pakistan, Kashmir Affairs & Gilgit - Baltistan Division Islamabad has constituted a Medical Board, consisting of Doctors of PIMS, who have conducted re - postmortem of the dead body of deceased Shabana Akhtar and submitted their exhumation /Postmortem report. 

According to the said report previously no internal postmortem was conducted by Doctor Dilshad Begum. 

The le arned Advocate General further submits that Dr. 

Dilshad Begum has prepared autopsy report countersigned by Dr. 

Wazir Muhammad without conducting the postmortem on the dead body of deceased. 

He submits that the respondents have voluntarily confessed their guilt before PW-09 Syed Gaib Ali Shah, the Magistrate and PW -19 Shahid Hussain while making the movie for CD whose evidence remained unrebutted as well as their credibility are also remain unchallenged. 

The CDs were

============================================================

============================================================

9 played in the Court and the accused h ave been asked question who have admitted the recoveries on their pointation. 

He submits that the learned Trial Court has rightly convicted the respondents in accordance with law and the said judgment was wrongly reversed by the learned Chief Court vide impugned majority judgment dated 20.10.2016. 

He prays that the impugned judgment may graciously be set aside by maintaining the judgment of the learned Trial Court. 

In supports of above contentions, the learned Advocate General relied upon case laws reported as 2007 SCMR 518 & 2009 SCMR 2669. 8. 

On the other hand, Mr. 

Amjad Hussain learned counsel for the respondent No. 02 & 03 supports the impugned judgment and contends that Section 6/7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 was/ is not attracted in this case. 

He also submits that motivation to criminal murders was purely based upon a personal and private grievance, which did not create fear and insecurity in society. 

Per learned counsel, there is no eye wi tness of the alleged occurrence and no direct evidence available on record against the accused. 

The height of the roof of the Dining Hall is 09 feet and the height of deceased was 05 feet 02 inches as such the deceased can approach the ceiling fan easily f or hanging h erself. 

He further contends that the CD and movie prepared by Investigation Officer (I.O) in presence of Magistrate is not admissible in

============================================================
PAGE 10
============================================================

10 evidence. 

There are contradictions between the statements of Magistrate and CD. 

He submits that the recover y of pillow and Dopatta is doubtful which cannot be used as circumstantial evidence against the respondents. 

Per learned counsel, the confessional statement of accused recorded under Section 21-H of the Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997 is not admissible in evidence. 

He contends that as per prosecution story, the tissue wrapped with chloroform was used to make the deceased unconscious but the same has not been recovered either from the place of occurre nce or from the accused which makes the case of the prosecution doubtful. 

In addition to the oral arguments the learned counsel for the respondent No. 02 & 03 also submitted written arguments. 

Per learned counsel, the statement of PW Syed Gaib Ali Shah is not admissible in evidence under Article 38 & 39 of Qanoon -e-Shahadat Order, 1984. 

He reiterates that the confession made by the respondents in police custody cannot be proved against respondents of any offence. 

The confession and facts narrated by the respondents while they were in custody is inadmissible in evidence. 

There is no direct evidence available against the respondents except the statement of PW Syed Gaib Ali Shah in whose presence alleged ly the respondents have confessed their guilt. 

Conviction on the testimony of Syed Gaib Ali Shah cannot be passed. 

The Extra Judicial Confession made by accused at the time when he was in custody of the police is

============================================================
PAGE 11
============================================================

11 inadmissible in evidence. 

The confessional statement and evidence of recoveries are purely a corroborative in nature are not capable to bring home charge against accused in absence of direct, substantive or direct evidence. 

The Conviction can not be based on any other type of evidence. 

He further contends that Criminal petition for leave to appeal has been filed against three (03) accused namely Nadeem Abbas, Jamila Bibi and Ijlal Hussain. 

Consequently, notices against Jamila Bibi and Ijlal Hussain have been served upon whereas notice against Nadeem Abbas has not been served upon, hence, criminal P etition for leave to appeal cannot be heard in absence of co -accused unless he has been declared absconder by this apex Court. 

The procedur e for declaration of the abscons ion of co -accused Nadeem Abbass has not been ordered by this Hon’ble Court as yet, th erefore, Criminal Petition for leave to appeal cannot be heard separately. 

Co - accused Nadeem Abbass may be issued notices according to the procedure to procure his atte ndance for the hearing of this case. 

Appeal against the accused is required to be heard jointly as provided under the Law. 

While saying so he relied upon the case laws reported as 2016 PCr.LJ 1134, 1995 PCr.LJ 313, 2009 SCMR 04, 2011 YLR 1369, 1995 SCMR 1793, 2016 P CR. 

LJ 1134, 2004 YLR 206, 2006 P Cr. 

LJ 358, 2005 SCMR 277 and 2016 MLD 114 4. 

Per learned counsel, the Prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against

============================================================
PAGE 12
============================================================

12 the re spondents. 

There is no eye witness who has seen the occurrence. 

The case is based on circumstantial evidence which are contradictory in nature. 

The learned Trial Court fell in error by convicting the respondents which has rightly been reversed by the learned Chief Court vide its majority decision. 

He prays that the impugned judgment may graciously be maintained. 9. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned judgment as well as the judgment passed by the learned Trial Court & case laws relied upon by the learned counsel s for the respective parties. 

We have also perused the confessional statement s of the respondent No. 01 Nadeem Abbas, Jamila Bibi respondent No. 02, Ijlal Hussain respondent No. 03 and gone through the deposition of PW -9 Syed Ghaib Ali Shah and PW -19 Shahid Hussain, who are independent witnesses whose evidence are inspiring confidence. 

We have also gone through the medical and circumstantial evidence which is corroborative in nature and connects the chain in proving against the respondents for the commission of the b rutal murder of the innocent girl. 

The evidence of PW-09, Syed Ghaib Ali Shah is corroborative in nature. 

He is an independent witness who on the request by the office of the Assistant Commissioner Gilgit was associated to inspect the site plan on the poin tation of the respondent No.
