He continued his services uninterruptedly till 2013 whereafter the respondent No. 06 stopped the monthly salary of the petitioner on the basis of erroneous entry of date of birth in the CNIC as 01.01.1952 which is clerical mistake of NADRA authorities.

The respondent No. 04 has acknowledged the correct date of birth of the petitioner vide letter dated 31.03.2013 and the same has been conveyed to NADRA authorities to rectify the clerical mistake made in the CNIC. 

The petitioner made request to remove the clerical mistake and prayed to declare his correct date of birth as 01.01.1958 but the NADRA authori ties are not ready to remove the same mistake. 

The petitioner also made request to direct the respondents not to stop his monthly salary but all in vain.

3 Per learned c ounsel the petitioner is performing his duties till now and the competent authorities have not issued any notificatio n for retirement. 

He submits that the respondent No. 06 illegally stopped the monthly salary of the petitioner on the basis of erroneous en try of date of birth in the CNIC which is against the law, procedure and the service rules. 

He prays that the impugned judgment dated 05.10.2016 in Service Appeal No. 282/2014 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Service Tribunal may graciously be set aside to meet the ends of justice. 4. 

On the other hand, the learned Advocate General supports the impugned judgment dated 05.10.2016 in Service Appeal No. 282/2014 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Service Tribunal. 

He contends that the date of birt h of the petitioner is 01.01.1952 according to CNIC and the record of service book is fake & fabricated.

He contends that the p etitioner has attained t he age of superannuation and he is no more government servant. 

He further contends that all the government employees are paid their pay & allowances throug h online system. 

The respondent entered, the date of birth of the petitioner according to the information furnished by his concerned department and the system itself stopped the salary of the petitioner on attaining the age of superannuation.

4 Tribunal may pleased be maintained being well reasoned and well founded. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned judgment which transpires that the Date of Birth as 01.01.1958 of the petitioner incorporated in his service book. 

Later on, his Date of Birth has inadvertently been entered in his CNIC as 01.01.1952 which may be a clerical mistake while feeding in compute r by NADRA. 

In our considered view, t he Date of Birth of the petitioner mentioned in the Matriculation Certificate as 01.01.1958 is correct which was subsequently entered in the Service Book of the petitioner accordingly. 6. 

In view of the above discussi ons, we allow this appeal. 

Consequent thereto, the impugned judgment dated 05.10.2016 in Service Appeal No. 282/2014 passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Service Tribunal is set aside. 

The respondents are directed to allow the petitioner to join his serv ice forthwith. 

He may be paid salaries etc as per permissible service rules. 7. 

The appeal is allowed in above terms.
