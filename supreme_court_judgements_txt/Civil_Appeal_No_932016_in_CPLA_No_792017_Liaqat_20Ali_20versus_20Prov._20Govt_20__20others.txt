Later on, the respondents called tender vide Notice dated 29.07.2015 for establishment of medical Store at DHQ Hospital Astore before completion of the construction of 30 -Bedded Hospital. 

An application under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 read with Section 151 CPC has also been filed by the petitioner for tem porary injunction restraining the respondents to eject the petitioner from the disputed medical Store. 

During hearing of the said suit the parties were directed to maintain status quo which remained intact till 14.11.2015.

3 3. 

The learned counsel for th e petitioner at the very outset submits that the impugned order is not sustainable as the forum of learned First Appellate Court has not been exhausted by the respondents and they have wrongly rushed to the learned Revisional Court. 

Per learned counsel, th e impugned order is liable to be set aside being illegal and without jurisdiction. 4. 

On the other hand, the learned Advocate General Gilgit - Baltistan supports the impugned order passed by the learned Chief Court. 

He, however, could not present any argum ents in support of his contentions. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned order. 

In our considered view, the impugned order has been passed without jurisdi ction, hence, the same is not tenable. 6. 

In view of the above discussions, we allow this appeal. 

Consequently, the impugned order dated 03.06.2016 in Civil Revision No. 48/2016 passed by the learned Chief Court is set aside by maintaining the order dated 25.05.2016 passed by the learned Senior Civil Judge Astor. 7. 

The appeal is allowed in above terms.
