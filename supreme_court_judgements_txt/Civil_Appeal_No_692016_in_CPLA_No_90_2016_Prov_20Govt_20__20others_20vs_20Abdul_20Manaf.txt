3 that the competent authority i.e. the then Chief Secretary Gilgit - Baltistan has directed to advertise the posts from BPS -01 to 05 from the respective Union Councils. 

He adds that the suit post was vacant in Union Council Qamri while the respondent belongs to Union Council Rehmanpore as such in presence of directives of the competent authority, the respondent could not be adjusted against the said post. 

He submits that the learned Chief Court fell in error while passing the impugned judgment dated 27.04.2014, hence, the same is not tenable in law. 

He prays that the said impugned judgment may graciously be set aside. 4. 

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent supports the impugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court. 

He contends that many posts of SUSs were created for District Astore and the same were initially filled in by appointing on contingent basis. 

Per learned counsel, the other contingent colleagues of the respondent were appointed/adjusted against the post on regular basis bu t the respondent was ignored by the petitioners inspite of the recommendation of petitioner No. 05 i.e. 

Deputy Director, LG&RD District Astore. 

He reiterates that the petitioners instead of regularizing the services of the respondent, changed his services into contractual basis but later on his contractual status was again changed into co ntingent before ending of the expiry of contractual period.

4 He prays that the impugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court may pleased be maintained to meet the ends of justice. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, perused the materials on record and gone through the impugned judgment passed by the learned Chief Court. 

The careful perusal of the case file transpires that the respondent has been appointed as SUC BPS -07 on contract basis against the vacant post for a period of one (01) year by an unauthorized officer i.e. 

Directo r LG&RD Gilgit Region who admittedly was/ is not competent to appoint the respondent. 

We are in agreement with the contentions raised by the learned Advocate General. 

In our considered view, the learned Chief Court fell in error while passing the impugned j udgment which is not tenable in law. 6. 

In view of the above discussions, we allow this appeal. 

Consequently, the impugned judgment dated 27.04.2016 in Writ Petition No. 36/2015 passed by the learned Chief Court is set aside. 

The respondent may approach the competent court of law for redressal of their grievances, if he so advised. 7. 

The appeal is allowed in above terms.
