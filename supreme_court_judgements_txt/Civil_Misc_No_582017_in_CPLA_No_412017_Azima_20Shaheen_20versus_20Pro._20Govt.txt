This petition for leave to appeal has arisen out of the impugned order dated 16.12.2016 passed by Gilgit -Baltistan Service Tribunal whereby the Service Appeal filed by the petitioner was dismissed in limini, hence, this petition for leave to appeal. 

This court vide order dated 24.08.2017 issued notices to the respondents and the case is heard today. 2. 

The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner was initially appointed on contract basis as teacher in Education Department Gilgit -Baltistan on 01.03.2012. 

Later on, her services were regularized by the respondents on 14.06.2012. 

On 10.03.2014 on the recommendation of the Departmental Committee the

2 appointment order of the petitioner was withdrawn on the ground that the petitioner was appointed against a non -existing post without fulfilling the codal formalities i.e. advertisement, test/interview etc b y constituting Departmental Selection Committee ( DSC). 

The petitioner being aggrieved filed Service Appeal which was dismissed in limini by the Gilgit -Baltistan Service Tribunal. 3. 

The learned counsel for the petition er submits that the petitioner was appointed by the competent authorities and she was performing her duties to the entire satisfaction to her superiors. 

Her services have been terminated illegally and without giving any reasons. 

He furt her submits that the petitioner was constrained to file Service Appeal in the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Service Tribunal which upon hearing was dismissed. 

Per learned counsel, the said impugned order is not sustainable and liable to be set aside by allowing this petition for leave to appeal. 4. 

On the other hand, the learned Advocate General supports the impugned order passed by the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Service Tribunal. 

He contends t he petitioner has been appointed illegally and unlawfully by the unauthorized officer without fulfilling the codal fo rmalities of the service rules. 

He further contends that the learned Gilgit -Baltistan Service Tribunal has rightly dismissed the Service Appeal of the petitioner as the same was not maintainable being barred by time. 

Admittedly, no Departmental Appeal was filed by the petitioner before approaching the learned

3 Gilgit -Baltistan Service Tribunal. 

He prays that the impugned order may graciously be maintained. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at lengt h, perused the material on record and gone through the impugned or der. 

Admittedly, the petitioner was appointed without fulfilling the codal formalities consequently a Special Recruitment Committee was constituted by the Gilgit -Baltistan Government to dete rmine the suitability and eligibility of the teachers who were appointed without sanction posts, advertisement and test & interview. 

The said committee after scrutinizing the academic testimonials of the candidates and after conducting test and interviews, recommended withdrawal of appointment order of 43 teachers/Lab Assistants, LDC including the petitioner with immediate effect. 

Since, the petitioner was not fulfilling the requisite qualification her appointment/Regularization order was withdrawn on 10.03.2014. 

Admittedly, no departmental appeal was filed by the petitioner before approaching the Gilgit -Baltistan Service tribunal. 

Further, the service appeal filed in Gilgit -Baltistan Service Tribunal was hopelessly time barred by two (02) years four (04) mo nths and four (04) days and no application was filed under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1908 for condonation of delay offering plausible and reasonable ground thereto. 

In our considered view, the impugned order is well founded as no infirmity has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioner.
