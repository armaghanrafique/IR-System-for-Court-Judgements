The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is in nocent and has falsely been implicated in the case. 

He also submits that the allegations against the petitioner are general, vague and ill -found. 

He also submits that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the petitioner has committed a non-baiabl e offence as alleged. 

Per learned counsel the FIR against the petitioner was lodged without resorting to the provisions of Section 196 Cr. 

P.C, hence, the subsequent proceedings are illegal and without lawful authority.
