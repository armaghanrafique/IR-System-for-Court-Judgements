2 2. 

The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner/plaintiff filed Civil Suit No. 38 -A/2010(19/2000, 37/2002, 5/2016) for cancellation of gift deed dated 08.07.2000 bearing registration No.08/2000 and for perpetual injection etc against the respondent which upon hearing was partially decreed to the extent of cancellation of gift deed dated 08.07.2000 whereas the prayer for perpetual injection was dismissed vide judgment dated 30.06.2012. 

The suit No.46/ 2011 filed by the respondent was decreed in favour of the resp ondent. 

Whereafter both the petitioner and the respondent feeling aggrieved filed Civil First Appeal Nos. 18/2012 and 20/2012 respectively which upon hearing were dismissed and the partial decree passed by the learned Trial Court in favour of the petitioner/plaintiff was also dismissed vide judgment dated 12.12.2012. 

The petitioner again assailed the judgment of the learned First Appellate Court be fore the learned Chief Court which upon hearing the impugned judgment was upheld, hence, this petition for leave to appeal. 3. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the disputed property is yet in the possession of the petitioner as he is the real owner of the property in question. 

He also submits that the gift deed effected on 08.07.2000 in favo ur of the petitioner was admitted by the respondent as well. 

He submits that the learned First Appellate Court and the learned Chief Court failed to appreciate this admitted fact and did not consider the same while passing the judgments. 

He reiterates that Mohammad, father of

3 Abdus Salam is real brother of one Bilal. 

So, Mohammad and Bilal are inter se real brothers. 

Mr. 

Mohammad is son of Bilal and Yusuf is son of Abdus Salam. 

Mr. 

Abdul Salam gifted his property through gift deed dated 25.05.1999 to his ne phew Mohammad and thereby deprived his son Yousaf. 

Mr. 

Yousaf filed suit for cancellation of the said gift deed before Collector while Mr. 

Muhammad filed suit for permanent injection. 

He submits that the learned courts below fell in error to consider the s aid gift and passed the impugned judgments which are not sustainable and liable to be set aside. 4. 

Conversely, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent supports the impugned judgment dated 11.06.2016 passed by the learned Chief Court. 

He contends that there are concurrent findings of the three courts below are well reasoned and well founded and no interference is warranted therein. 5. 

We have heard the learned counsels for the respective parties at length, peruse d the record of the case file and gone through the concurrent findings of th ree courts below. 

The learned counsel for the petitioner could not point out any illegality and infirmity in the impugned judgment dated 11.06.2016 passed by the learned Chief Court. 6. 

In view of the above discussions we dismissed this appeal vide our short order dated 05.10.2016. 

Consequently, the impugned order dat ed 11.06.2014 in Civil Revision No. 05/2013 passed by the learned Chief court and the concurrent findings of the courts below were maintained. 

These were the reasons for the said short order.
