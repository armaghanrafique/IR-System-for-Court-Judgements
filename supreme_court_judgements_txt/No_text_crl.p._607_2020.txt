Underthecircumstances, it isnot determinable thatas towhooutoftheabovementioned three(03) accused causedthesaidsingleinjuryonthebodyofthedeceased andassuchthereisadoubtintheprosecution storyquathe involvement ofLaiqShah(petitioner), inthiscase.Reference inthis context maybemadetothejudgment reported as“Farman Ali and 3othersv.TheState”(PLD1980Supreme Court201),wherein at pageNo.205, thisCourthasheldasunder:- wasfoundtohavesuffered seveninletwounds, threeof themin hisleftKneejoint,oneon hisleftelbow,twoinhis abdomen and oneinbackward direction tohis rightsuperior iliacspine,theinlet-size ofallofwhichis saidtobe the same,wouldgo alongway toshowthatthiscouldaswell betheworkof asinglepersonandnotofthethree appellants. 

Thereisnoevidence on therecordtoshow, however, astowhichoneof thethreehadcausedhimthe saidinjuries, therefore, nooptionisleft buttohold that the prosecution hasfailedto bring homeitscaseagainstany oneof theappellants. 5.Likewise, nospecific injuryonthebodiesof theinjured PWs ofthiscasenamely Humayun (PW-2)andBabarZai(PW-3), was assigned tothepresent petitioner.

FsAspercontents oftheFIR,themotivebehindtheoccurrence wasanoldenmitybetween theparties.Eventhemotivewasjointly allegedagainstthepetitioner and his twoco-accused. 

Avagueand ambiguous motiveregarding oldenmitywasallegedinthecontents of theFIRandnodetailofthesaidenmity wasgiventherein. 

However, HajiAbdulRazzaq (PW-6), hadstatedduringhiscross- examination thathisdaughter wasmarriedwiththenephew ofthe petitioner, whowassonofIbrahim Shah(co-accused sinceP.O)and hisdaughter wasmurdered bytheaccused party.Admittedly the daughter ofthecomplainant wasnotmarriedwiththesonof the present petitioner. 

Thecomplainant himselfadmitted inhiscross- examination thatLaiqShah(petitioner), wasletof bythepolicein theabove-referred earliercase,whichshowsthatthepetitioner was notfoundinvolved inthesaidearliercasebythepolice.Underthe circumstances, therewasnomotivewiththepetitioner tocommit theoccurrence. 8.It islastlyarguedbythelearnedStateCounsel thatthe petitioner remained anabsconder inthiscase,whichalso corroborates theprosecution case.Inthisrespect, it iswellsettled bynowthatwhen a personignamedasamurderer inacase, whether rightlyorwrongly, heusuallybecomes scaredandtriesto conceal himself inordertoavoidpossible policetorture and detention, therefore, mereabscondence ofanaccused byitselfis not sufficient tomaintain hisconviction andsentence in absence of otherreliableevidence.
