(c)any other relief which this august court deems fit and proper according to the nature of instant petition, may also be granted to the petitioner in the larger interest of public at large of northern areas to achieve the ends of justice. this court while taking cognizance of the matter in original jurisdiction under article of northern areas governance order in the public interest litigation passed the following order on :- the petitioner being secretary general gilgit baltistan trade union federation has filed this petition under article of northern areas governance order, readwith article ,,, and of the constitution of pakistan on behalf of gilgit baltistan workers for extension of industrial relation act in northern areas. the learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the people of northern areas being citizens of pakistan are equally entitled to the benefit of labour laws enforced in pakistan, and that without the application of i.r act, in northern areas, the labour class and trade unions of this area are not only deprived of their basic right of access to the contention raised involves constitutional question of public importance, therefore subject to all just exceptions, and removal of defects in the petition, we grant leave in this petition to consider inter alia the above question relating to the fundamental rights of the people of northern areas. the copy of this petition will be sent to the secretary ka na division for reply and concise statement. in view of the importance of the matter, we deem it proper to ask learned attorney general for pakistan to assist the court and would also request to based at lahore and dr. aslam khaki president high court bar association islamabad and bar association as well as president chief court bar association gilgit, and the advocate general northern areas, will also provide assistance to the court. the appeal shall be set down for hearing on the present record with permission to the parties to place on record additional documents this petition in representative capacity has been filed by the petitioner on behalf of the workers of government, sámi government and private organizations in the northern areas mainly on the ground that this is not practicable for the individual workers to raise the common grievance through separate petitions therefore this direct petition on behalf of workers on the basis of common cause may be entertained. the request seems to be reasonable therefore in the interest of we entertain the same and grant permission to the petitioner to represent the workers in representative capacity. the sole question raised before us requiring determination is that labour class in nas has not been provided the machinery of statutory law for enforcement of their rights available to them under different laws of pakistan enforced in northern areas and have been deprived of the fundamental right of equality and equal protection of law guaranteed under article of the constitution of pakistan read with article -a of the nortehrn areas governance order, the iro was repealed by iro which was also not extended to nas and then iro was substituted with industrial relation act but this act also has not been extended to gilgit baltistan, similarly, the application of3 page certain other labour laws in the nas has been withheld, although more then laws of the federal government are enforced in nas. the learned counsel submitted that despite regular demand made and assurance given by the kashmir affairs northern areas division for extension of iro and ir act with other labour laws in nas, nothing has been done so far, as a result of which the poor and depressed labour class in this region is being exploited in respect of their legal rights by the employers and the management of different public and private organizations, in violation of article of the constitution of pakistan. the learned counsel submitted that non application of iro or ir act or an alternate statute and other labour laws referred to above in nas is discriminatory and violative of articles ,,,,, of the constitution of pakistan read with article -a of the northern areas governance order as a result of which the workers on large scale in government and semi government departments, autonomous bodies and private organizations functioning in nortehrn areas in which transport companies, construction companies, na pwd, municipal corporation, flour mills, hotel industries and many other public and private organizations are included are deprived of their basic right and are not being treated at par to those of the workers of similar organizations in the other parts of the country in respect of their rights under labour laws. the learned advocate general northern areas has submitted that the federal or a provincial law cannot be ipso facto made applicable in northern areas unless it is extended by a notification to be issued by the federal government and has placed a list of laws on record which have already been made applicable to northern areas. he has submitted that although the territory of northern areas is not as such included in the territory of pakistan as defined in article of the4 page constitution of pakistan, but factually nas is a part of pakistan and the people of northern areas are citizens of pakistan by virtue of citizenship act and informed the court that workman compensation act the factories act the old age employees benefit act have been made applicable in nas, whereas the other labour laws referred to above which are enforced in pakistan have not been extended to northern areas. the learned advocate general has thus conceded that non-application of labour laws in northern areas is discriminatory to the people of this area in terms of article of the constitution of pakistan read with article -a of nas governance order and consequently the labour class in nas is deprived of equal protection of law for exercise of their right of formation of union under article -a of governance order read with article () of the constitution of pakistan for effective protection of their rights recognized under the law. senior advocate and president supreme appellate court bar association has submitted that during british rule the control of northern areas of pakistan was given to maha raja kashmir by the british government and six months after partition the people of northern areas by giving defeat to the forces of maha raja kashmir with the help of government of pakistan occupied this area and established self government system in the form of different states under the control of government of pakistan but subsequently on the abolishment of these states, northern areas came under the direct control of federal government of pakistan. the learned counsel with reference to article of the constitution of pakistan has submitted that the territory of northern areas under the constitution of pakistan is not as such included in the territory of pakistan but by virtue of5 page clause (d) of article of the constitution, this area is included in pakistan for all practical purposes and being part of federation of pakistan is under the direct control and supervision of the government of pakistan with de-facto status of territory of pakistan, therefore all federal laws without any formal notification would ipso facto be operative in northern areas and notwithstanding the exemption of the application of certain laws for the benefit of people of northern areas, the exclusion of a law including labour laws referred to above recognizing certain rights of people from operation in northern areas is against the public policy and natural justice. advocate, president northern areas chief court bar association, argued that in the light of definition of territory of pakistan in the constitution of pakistan and the factual status of northern areas, it is natural part of pakistan and consequently no special order or notification is required for the application of the labour laws in northern ares but unfortunately on the basis of wrong notion, the policy of pick and choose has been adopted for application of federal laws in this area as a result of which the basic rights of people are infringed for want of proper forum and remedy. senior advocate, supreme court of pakistan, on request of court, appeared as amicus curie for assistance and while tracing the history of the state of jammu and kashmir he has submitted that originally northern areas was not part of jammu and kashmir, rather the british government by virtue of a contract handed over the control of this area to maha raja state of jammu and kashmir and after partition of sub continent northern areas came under the administrative control of pakistan, therefore notwithstanding the fact that it was not as such included in the territory of pakistan which has been defined in6 page article of the constitution of pakistan, this area for all practical purposes, is treated as a part of pakistan so much so internationally it is not as such recognized a disputed territory, and in view thereof this is not fair to deprive the people of northern areas from their legal and constitutional rights recognized under the constitution of pakistan for mere reason that constitutionally this area is not included in the territory of pakistan. the learned counsel with reference to article read with article of the constitution submitted that in consequence to the right of freedom of association recognized under the constitution, the supreme court of pakistan has examined the vires of the relevant statutes including political parties act and iro in the cases involving the question relating to the validity of certain provisions of these statutes which offended the constitutional right of association on the touch stone of article read with article of the constitution of pakistan. in support of the argument learned counsel has relied upon the case titled civil aviation authority v. union of civil aviation employees (pld s.c in which it was held by the supreme court of pakistan as under: it may be pointed out that the effect of the exclusion of application of the provisions of iro to the employees of the establishment mentioned in clauses (a) to (h) of subsection () of section thereof, which includes the corporation (i.e pakistan television corporation), is that there is no statute in the field corresponding to iro under which the employees of the establishments mentioned therein can formulate and operate a union or to press into service the mechanism provided in the iro for regulating relations, between employers and workers and for avoidance and settlement of differences disputes. it may further be observed that section of the ordinance by providing that iro shall not apply to or in relation to the authority or any person in the service of the authority, purports to achieve the above objective. learned counsel has submitted that certain laws included in schedule of this order are within the legislative dominion of northern areas legislative assembly, whereas the laws on the subject under discussion for enforcement of right of formation of union as provided under article () of the constitution of7 page pakistan is to be enacted by the federal government or the law already enforced in pakistan has to be extended to nas by issue of notification by the federal government, as no federal or provincial law can be made applicable to northern areas without issuance of a proper notification by the federal government. the learned counsel has laid much emphasize on the point that mere extension of laws in nas is of no use unless the labour union activities in term of article () of the constitution read with article -a of governance order are allowed and added that in absence of labour unions the right of individual workers can not be effectively protected in the spirit of constitution as has been held by supreme court of pakistan in pld sc, page learned counsel while concluding his argument has submitted that ir act is a temporary legislation which is operative for a limited period, therefore a permanent law on the subject is required to be enacted as the problem being faced by the worker class in nas will not be solved by application of a temporary legislation. the contention of the learned counsels has given birth, inter alia to the following questions for our consideration. (a)whether all federal laws would be deemed to have been automatically applicable to northern areas which is considered as part of federation of pakistan and is under direct control of federal government without issue of formal notification for the extension of such laws to the northern areas or not. (b)whether non application of iro or or ir act to northern areas is not violative of article () read with article of the constitution of pakistan and article -a of northern areas governance order and is not discriminatory. page (c)whether fundamental right of formation of union provided under article () of the constitution of pakistan being subject to integrity and security of pakistan, non application of iro and or ir act to northern areas because of its location is justified. learned counsel for the petitioner, the advocate general northern areas, and the federal government has filed comments to this petition, after the judgment was reserved after the close of arguments of learned counsel whereas deputy attorney general without appearing in court has submitted comments on behalf of attorney general for pakistan. in view of the importance of the matter we before proceeding further and diluting upon the question of law raised in this petition, at the first instance deem it proper to determine the constitutional status of northern areas which was originally called gilgit baltistan. this is noticeable that on establishment of british rule in the sub-continent the british government had given the administrative control of nas to maharaja jammu and kashmir and soon after partition of sub continent maharaja lost the control of this area which came under the control of government of pakistan but in the constitution of pakistan this area as such has not been included in the territory of pakistan which is defined in article of the constitution of pakistan as under:- the republic and its territories. () pakistan shall be a federal republic to be known as the islamic republic of pakistan, hereinafter referred to as pakistan. ()the territories of pakistan shall comprise_9 page (a)the provinces of baluchistan, the north-west frontier, the punjab and sind; (b)the islamabad capital territory, hereinafter referred to as the federal capital; (c)the federally administered tribal areas; and (d)such states and territories as are or may be included in pakistan, whether by accession or otherwise. () majlis-e-shoora (parliament) may by law admit into the federation new states or areas on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit. in the light of definition of territory of pakistan, nas by virtue of clause (d) of article () of the constitution is treated as part of territory of pakistan and is included in federation of pakistan, notwithstanding the fact that before the partition it being under the control of maharaja jammu and kashmir was considered as part of state of jammu and kashmir for allied purposes. the essential question for determination in view of the constitutional status of northern areas would be the considerations for the classification of laws for the purpose of application of a particular law to this region. the people of northern areas are citizens of pakistan and notwithstanding the location and importance of this area form strategic point of view, the fundamental rights guaranteed in chapter i part ii of the constitution of pakistan have been made part of northern areas governance order by virtue of article -a of said order without any distinction or discrimination and in case of any violation of the fundamental rights the courts in northern areas are empowered to pass appropriate order for enforcement of these rights. article of the northern areas governance order is substitution of article () of constitution of pakistan for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental rights, which provides an expeditious and inexpensive remedy for the enforcement of the fundamental rights in the matter involving question of public importance. the superior courts in pakistan as well as in northern areas have very10 page wide powers to pass an order for enforcement of fundamental rights or give direction in the form of declaration and for implementation of such order or direction all executive and judicial authorities are bound to act in aid of the courts. the governance order of northern areas not only provide protection of fundamental rights envisaged in chapter i of part ii of constitution of pakistan but also empowers the superior courts i.e. chief court and supreme appellate court for enforcement of these rights. the supreme appellate court in exercise of its original jurisdiction under article of the northern areas governance order in a case involving question of public importance relating to the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by article -a of the order read with chapter i part ii of the constitution of pakistan may pass an appropriate order and give direction, therefore any rigid interpretation in respect of the exercise of the powers by the court for enforcement of fundamental rights would be against the concept and spirit of the above provision. the language of article of the northern areas governance order and article () of the constitution of pakistan is open ended and legislation did not intend any rigid or ceremonious exercise of jurisdiction to place any restraint on the power of the supreme appellate court, northern areas and supreme court of pakistan for enforcement of fundamental rights. the objection to the maintainability of this petition on the ground that the petitioner is not a recognized agent or a representative body of the labour class in nas would be a rigid interpretation to recognize fundamental right of formation of labour union of people of northern areas under article () of the constitution of pakistan read with article -a of nas governance order this is settled principle of law that a direct petition involving a question of public importance11 page with reference to the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the constitution and law can be brought by any person and the question of locus standi of a person, whether he is directly aggrieved or not is of no significance. reliance may be placed on miss benazir bhutto v. federation of pakistan pld sc the learned deputy attorney general in the comments filed on behalf of the attorney general of pakistan without denying the right of forming labour union by the workers in different organization in nas in terms of article () of the constitution of pakistan and the law on the subject has laid much stress on the maintainability of this petition under article of the governance order whereas the federal government through chief secretary has submitted comments as under:- with all respect and humility, it is submitted as under: ()that the petitioner have no locus standi to file the titled cpla. ()that the status of titled cpla may be petition of representative nature, therefore, it was obligatory for the petitioner to obtain necessary permission before filing the same but such permission is missing in the titled cpla. ()that the petitioner have failed to provide any documentary proof for agitating the matter in issue before relevant authority, who was authorized under the northern areas governance order, since the petitioner have an adequate remedy to redress their grievance, therefore, they are not legally entitled to get any relief from this ()that the government of pakistan is doing sincere efforts for the prosperity of the people of northern areas, recently the federal cabinet have approved many amendments in legal and political field, the said amendments are under the process of acceptance by the competent authority. some press clippings are attached herewith as annexures a and keeping in view the above submission, it is most respectfully prayed that the titled cpla no. may very kindly be dismissed. page the federal government in its comments has not raised serious objection to the extension of industrial relation act to the northern areas rather impliedly conceded the legal rights of the labour class in northern areas without any distinction. be that as it may the question as to whether the ir act should be extended to nas or not is a question of great public importance which directly relates to the fundamental rights of the people of nas, therefore this question requires decision on the touch stone of fundamental right of formation of union for collective benefit of labour class. northern areas is governed by northern areas governance order and different federal and provincial laws including certain labour laws except iro and ir act have been made applicable to this area by issuance of separate notifications. the forming of labour union as such is not prohibited but without application of ir act or an alternate statute for enforcement of right of forming of labour unions under article () readwith article -a of the governance order in an effective manner, this right would be meaningless because a labour union without legal recognition would not be in a position to render any service to labour class or plead their cases in representative capacity before the appropriate forums. the fundamental right in terms of article () of the constitution without the machinery of law for its enforcement would be of no significance and in view of the legal position no exception can be taken to the maintainability of this petition which involves question of public importance relating to the enforcement of fundamental rights. consequently, the objection of the deputy attorney general that this direct petition under article of northern areas governance order is not maintainable. the general principal for invoking the original jurisdiction of the court under article of governance order is the same as in the spirit of article () page of the constitution of pakistan. the consideration for direct petition before this court is that whether or not a question of public importance is actually involved with reference to the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by the northern areas governance order and if the above two essential elements are found in the case before the court notwithstanding the availability of an alternate remedy under the law, the court can take cognizance of the matter on a petition moved by an individual or by an association in representative capacity. this is recognized principle that if the proceedings are in the nature of public interest litigation the power conferred on this court under article read with article -a of the governance order can be exercised liberally without the fetters of technicalities to advance the cause of justice. in consequence thereto we hold that this direct petition under article read with article -a of the governance order in the original jurisdiction of this court involving the question of public importance relating to the enforcement of fundamental rights of the labour class is maintainable in public interest litigation. this may be pointed out that initially industrial relations ordinance was made applicable to the northern areas but subsequently for the reasons best known to the concerned authorities in the federal government the operation of this law from northern areas was withdrawn. the exclusion of the application of provisions of industrial relations ordinance or non application of industrial relation act to the northern areas being violative of article () of the constitution of pakistan and article -a of northern areas governance order was without any constitutional or legal justification. this is correct that article () does not recognize the right of union of employees of all organizations rather this right is subject to the limitation and restriction imposed by the law in special circumstances and withholding of the law for enforcement of14 page fundamental right guaranteed under article () in respect of an organization for special reasons may not be discriminatory or against the principle of equality before law and equal protection of law. the industrial relation ordinance or act as the case may be, provides the mechanism of registration and operation of union and the recognition of collective bargaining agent to raise the charter of demand and the manner of settlement of the dispute between employers and employees through negotiation. in northern areas no such statute is available for the registration and operation of labour union for redressal of the grievances of individual workers or their collective demand, as a result thereof the right of formation of unions as a legitimate representative body of workers cannot be effectively exercised for the welfare of labour class in the area. in absence of law on industrial relations for invoking the provision of article () of the constitution in northern areas the labour class in this areas would not be able to protect and enforce their legal and constitutional right in proper manner. the concept of formation of association or union is based on the fact that certain rights are inherent in such associations or unions including the right to act as a legally recognized agent of the labour class and non availability of law for enforcement of above right would be direct denial of the right of labour and worker to enforce their rights before the appropriate forums such as labour courts or nirc as the case may be. the union is an organization of workers to watch their interest in respect of their wages and working conditions and an unregistered union may have legal entity for certain other purposes but it cannot function as a representative body because it has no legal recognition to act as representative of workers to enter into a binding contract with the employer. whereas a registered union having the legal recognition can perform all acts permissible under law and can also enter into a binding contract with employer on behalf of the employees. it was held in the15 page case of civil aviation authority v. union of civil aviation employees (pld sc as under: in order to make article () of the constitution meaningful for the purpose of formation of the unions and their operation, it is incumbent for the legislature to provide a legal framework either in the form of iro or any other alternate statute, seems to be correct. we have already pointed out hereinabove that the iro provides an exhaustive mechanism for the formation, registration and operation of the unions. it also provides the procedure, as to how a collective bargaining agent on behalf of workers is to be elected and in what manner a charter of demands can be raised by the employees, how it is to be negotiated and in case of failure to arrive at an amicable settlement between the employer and the employees, what coercive steps the employees can take. it also caters for the hierarchy for resolving the industrial disputes. in the light of the contention of senior advocate, supreme court of pakistan that the right of freedom of association and forming of union in terms of article () of the constitution read with article -a of the governance order is a constitutional right which cannot be denied except in the cases of organization which have been excluded from the purview of article of the constitution by law for special reason and consideration and in consequence thereto, the classification of northern areas for the purpose of law of industrial relation was unconstitutional and without any legal justification is not without force and substance. article () of the constitution of pakistan guarantees the right of freedom of association and forming of union, whereas separate machinery of law is provided for the enforcement of right of association and this right of freedom of association and forming of union is guaranteed by virtue of article -a of northern areas governance order to the people of northern areas which is fundamental document to run the affairs of northern areas but in the absence of machinery of law for the implementation of this right, the question requiring consideration would be whether non application of industrial relation act or16 page an alternate statute on the subject is not a restriction on the exercise of right of association union in northern areas and if this restriction is considered essential and reasonable then what is the substantial reason for this classification and if it is not so, how the unions without legal recognition can effectively work for the rights of individual worker or for collective interest of workers. in absence of any substantial reason for such restriction we have found much force in the arguments of senior advocate, supreme court of pakistan that to make the article () of the constitution meaningful, the formation of the unions and for their proper functioning the extension of ir act or enactment of alternate statute for northern areas was essential. the labour union is an organization of workers and basic function of the labour union is to bargain with the employer for their rights and service benefit and these labour unions without legal recognition may not be in a position to negotiate with the employers with full strength and legal force. there is no bar on the working of a union without registration, but a labour union is not recognized as a representative body without registration under the law and also it cannot effectively protect the rights of workers, therefore, subject to the reasonable restriction imposed by law in the interest of sovereignty or integrity of pakistan, public order and morality, the right of registration of union under the law must be recognized as constitutional right in terms of article () of the constitution as without authority of law the right of association in the form of legally recognized representative body cannot be exercised. this being so, the statutory law for registration of union is necessary as without registration a union cannot be in a position to act as an agent of the workers, which is its inherent right and without legal recognition also cannot adopt coercive measures for acceptance of the17 page demands of workers. the net result of the above discussion is that statutory law for the purpose of forming of a union in term of article () of the constitution is not necessary but the legal sanction for a representative body for the negotiations with employees on behalf of workers is essential and a union without such authority and recognition under statutory law cannot perform such function therefore it is constitutional duty of the government to provide the statutory law for implementation and enforcement of rights recognized under article () of the constitution failing which this right would deem to have been denied. the perusal of the comments of federal government would show that the comments have not been offered in context to the real question relating to the enforcement of fundamental rights and providing the remedy for the enforcement of such rights, rather the side issues have been discussed, which have no direct nexus with article of the constitution of pakistan read with article -a of governance order and the remedy to be provided for enforcement of the rights guaranteed thereunder. the federal government also has not offered any reason for non extension of industrial relation act to the northern areas or enactment of an alternate statute to recognize the right of labour class in terms of article -a of governance order and treat them at par to the labour class and workers in other parts of the country. the right of formation of union is recognized as fundamental right under nas governance order, therefore no exception can be taken to accept the right of registration of labour union of the labour class in the northern areas either under industrial relation act a temporary statute enforced in pakistan or by providing an alternate statute on the subject for recognition of the legal status of these unions. the statutory law on the subject is certainly in the interest of both employees and the employers for the18 page purpose of regulating their relation inter se on equitable basis with certain restrictions, therefore the federal government subject to the reasonable restrictions on the functioning of unions by making suitable amendments in the industrial relation act may extend it to northern areas until an alternate statutory law is framed for enforcement of the right of association of union in northern areas in terms of article () of the constitution of pakistan read with article -a of northern areas governance order the crucial question requiring determination would relate to the extension of industrial relation act to nas and there is no cavil to the proposition that there is no right without a remedy and any restriction on the enforcement of legal or constitutional right impliedly or expressly directly or indirectly would amount curtailment of such right. the right of forming the labour union is recognized under article () of the constitution read with northern areas governance order, and not withstanding the fact that northern areas is not as such included in the territory of pakistan which has been defined in article of the constitution of pakistan it is for all intends and purposes is an integral part of pakistan and is under direct control of the federal government. the people of nas by virtue of citizenship act are citizens of pakistan and have been granted fundamental rights provided in chapter i part ii of the constitution of pakistan readwith article -a of the northern areas governance order this is matter of record that except a few all federal laws have been extended to nas and are enforced without any distinction. the basic document for governance of northern areas is governance order (now gilgit baltistan (empowerment and self governance) order which having the status of constitution for this areas set out the fundamental principles in respect of the rights and duties of the19 page state and the system of government in northern areas whereunder the government20 page is obliged to provide the machinery of law with remedies for the enforcement of the rights, guaranteed under the constitution and law. the supreme court of pakistan in the case title al jehad trust federation of pakistan scmr ), while holding that people of northern areas are citizen of pakistan, for all intents and purposes and like other citizens of pakistan have the right to invoke any of the fundamental right mentioned in part ii chapter- i of the constitution of pakistan issued direction for the enforcement of the fundamental rights through a independent judiciary. the federal government having made chapter i part ii of the constitution relating to the fundamental rights as part of the northern areas governance order, has recognized the right of forming of labour union by the labour class but has not provided any law for enforcement of this fundamental right in northern areas which is open discrimination in terms of article of the constitution of pakistan read with the article -a of northern areas governance order the provision of article of the constitution which are embodied in article -a of northern areas governance order may be subject to reasonable classification and there is no general standard for the test of reasonableness, rather it depends upon the circumstances which may justify different treatment on the basis of principal of reasonable classification but the restriction on the exercise of legal rights for the reason which may not be capable to justify the restriction before the court of law, will make the restriction on the right guaranteed under the law and constitution unreasonable. the universal principal of legislation at provincial or federal level, that it is made on the basis of geographical situation, the cultural environment, the social and economic considerations. the classification in respect of legislation merely on territorial basis is not recognized rather it may be one21 page considerations among others. this may be pointed out that the principle of equality before law and equal protection of law is recognized in the constitution with the concept of reasonable classification but this classification is not as such applicable in respect of fundamental rights rather the same is applied in ordinary law for enforcement of constitutional rights. the concept of reasonable classification under article of the constitution of pakistan is based on certain principles which may permit the application of a particular law to a particular area or group of people or class of persons and these principals are laid down in i.a sherwani v. government of pakistan (pld scmr as under: (i)the equal protection of law does not envisage that every citizen is to be treated alike in all circumstances, but it contemplates that persons similarly situated or similarly placed are to be treated alike; (ii)the reasonable classification is permissible but it must be founded on reasonable distinction or reasonable basis; (iii)the different laws can validly be enacted for different sexes, persons in different age groups, persons having different financial standings, and persons accused of heinous crimes; (iv)that no standard of universal application to test reasonableness of a classification can be laid down as what may be reasonable classification in a particular set of circumstances may be unreasonable in the other set of circumstances; (v)the law applying to one person or one class of persons may be constitutionally valid if there is sufficient basis or reason for it, but a classification which is arbitrary and is not founded on any rational basis is no classification as to warrant its exclusion from the mischief of article (vi)the equal protection of law means that all persons equally placed be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed; (vii)in order to make a classification reasonable, it should be based a.on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes person or tings that are grouped together from those who have been left out; b.the differentia must have rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by such classification. in the light of above criterion of reasonable classification the withholding of machinery of law for enforcement of the right of forming association which is recognized under article -a of the northern areas governance order is discriminatory. page the reasonable classification means that every citizen is not to be treated alike in all circumstances rather it contemplates that person facing similar situation are to be treated alike. there is no cavil to the proposition that reasonable classification for the purpose of application of a law is permissible but it must be founded on the reasonable distinction or basis. the different laws can validly be made for different classes of the people in the society to protect their rights on the basis of reasonable classification therefore, no standard of universal application to the test of reasonableness of classification can be laid down, because a reasonable classification in a particular set of circumstance may be unreasonable in another set of circumstances. the application of law to a group or class of person in the society may be legally valid if there are sufficient basis or reasons for such classification but if it is not founded on any rational basis it is certainly beyond the scope of article of the constitution. the equal protection of law means that all person equally placed be treated alike in respect of the privileges and the liabilities and a reasonable classification must be based on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes a person or group of person from other person or group of person and this differentia must have rational basis to the object sought to be achieved by the classification. the constitutionally of law may not be affected on account of its applicability to a group or class of persons in special circumstances or reasons but in absence of such reasons or circumstances there would be no justification for creation of classes for the purpose of application of a particular law. there is always a presumption in favour of validity of a law unless it is proved that a law has been enacted in transgression of the constitutional principles. the essential ingredient of article of the constitution read with article a of page areas governance order is that the violation must not be only confined to the extent that a person has been treated differently from others rather he has been treated differently from others in similar circumstances without any reasonable base and such deferential treatment has been made unjustifiably. the legislative presumption is in favour of beneficial interpretation of the provision and in the light thereof the industrial relation act which is applicable in whole of the pakistan would impliedly be extended to northern areas notwithstanding the fact that this area as such is not defined as territory of pakistan in the constitution of pakistan. the principle of classification laid down in article of the constitution read with article -a of the governance order cannot be made applicable as general proposition to every case in all circumstances rather the application of this principle depends on the facts of each case and the purpose of enactment of statute therefore in particular circumstances the classification may be legal and valid but if the enactment is on the basis of arbitrary or versical consideration it is not valid. it is clear from the plain reading of article of the constitution read with article -a of the governance order that without providing machinery of law for the enforcement of fundamental rights provided therein would negate the concept of the fundamental rights. the industrial relation act was enacted for the enforcement of the right of freedom of association and union therefore withholding of the application of such law to northern areas without providing an alternate statute would amount to deprive the labour class in northern areas from exercising their right of association and union for effective enforcement of their legal rights under labour laws. this necked situation clearly offends the principal of reasonable classification as envisaged in article of the constitution of24 page pakistan and has negated the right of forming union guaranteed to the people of nas under article -a of northern areas governance order the supreme court of india in the case of all india bank employees association v. the national industrial tribunal (bank disputes), bombay and others (air sc held as under:- we do not consider the inference sought to be drawn well founded. what the learned judges of the supreme court were referring to as a fundamental right was not with reference to a fundamental right as recognized or guaranteed by the constitution, but in the sense of a right of unions which enacted law recognized or respected, and as other decisions of the united states supreme court show, was subject to regulation by the legislature. we have, therefore, reached the conclusion that the right guaranteed by sub-clause (c) of clause () of article does not carry with it a concomitant right that the unions formed for protecting the interest of labour shall achieve the purpose for which they were brought into existence, such that any interference to such achievement by the law of the and would be unconstitutional unless the same could be justified as in the interest of public order or morality. in our opinion, the right guaranteed under sub- clause (c) of clause () of article extends to the formation of an association and is so far as the activities of the association are concerned or as regards the steps which the union might take to achieve the purpose of its creation, they are subject to such law as might be framed and that the validity of such laws is not to be tested by reference to the criteria to be found in clause () of article of the constitution. the question regarding discrimination in respect of right guaranteed under article of the constitution of pakistan read with article -a of the governance order would require consideration in the light of principle of equal protection of law. the preamble of industrial relation act (act no iv of is to expedite, consolidate and reconcile the law relating to labour unions for regulation of relation between employer and workman and in case of any difference of opinion on a matter or dispute arise between them the method for the settlement of dispute has been provided. the ir act has been extended to the hole of pakistan and in plain meanings it would also be applicable to the northern areas, notwithstanding the fact that northern areas as such constitutionally is page included in territory of pakistan by virtue of article of constitution of pakistan but factually it is an integral part of the federation of pakistan for all practical purposes and is directly governed by the federal government of pakistan therefore, it can safely be said that northern areas is defacto territory of pakistan and laws of pakistan may not ipso facto be applicable but the government of pakistan is obliged either to extend the federal laws beneficial to the northern areas by issuing a formal notification or enact the law for public welfare and interest. the industrial relations act is substitution of iro and iro which were enacted for recognition of the fundamental rights of forming of union provided under article () of the constitution of pakistan, which is part of article -a of northern areas governance order and in the light thereof the right of association and union of the people of northern areas has been acknowledged, but the forum for the enforcement of this right has not been provided as a result of which a distinction has been created in respect of the right of equality and equal protection of law as envisaged in article of the constitution of pakistan read with article -a of the governance order in consequence to the above discussion, we are of the considered view that fundamental rights cannot be suspended or taken away by any authority except in the manner provided by the constitution itself and the machinery of law providing remedy for the enforcement of such rights is part of such fundamental rights therefore the answer to the question as to whether without remedy the right itself has not been taken away is that withholding the remedy would amount to infringement of the right. page this is an admitted fact that most of the federal laws including certain labour laws have already been extended in northern areas but this is not understandable that why the application of iro or or ir act providing remedy for enforcement of fundamental rights under article () of the constitution read with article -a of northern areas governance order have been withheld. the rights of labour class provided in different labour laws cannot be enforced and protected without providing the appropriate forum for their enforcement, and thus in absence of specific remedy under the law for enforcement of legal right would amount to deprive the people from their rights. in the light of above discussion and legal position, we hold that the forming of union is fundamental right of the labour class and withholding the application of law for enforcement of such right would amount to the infringement of fundamental right. this petition thus succeeds in terms of short order passed on -- as under: this direct petition under article of repealed northern areas governance order, and now under article of gilgit baltistan (empowerment and self governance) order has been filed by all gilgit baltistan workers trade union federation through its general secretary against the federation of pakistan through secretary ka na (ka gb) division and others seeking the direction as under: respondent may very kindly be directed for immediate extension of industrial relations act and other labour related laws including workers welfare fund ordinance workman compensation act payment of wages act factories act mines act provincial employees social security ordinance, employees old age benefit act west pakistan shops and establishment workers welfare ordinance companies profit (workers participation) act, employees cost of living (relief) act, road transport workers ordinance west pakistan industrial commercial employment (standing workers) ordinance minimum wages for unskilled workers ordinance workers welfare fund ordinance and the finance act in the northern areas. keeping in view the importance of the matter relating to the enforcement of fundamental right of formation of trade labour unions for protection of legal rights of workers in representative capacity in gilgit27 page baltistan (northern areas), we have requested sr. advocate supreme court of pakistan, sr. advocate and president supreme appellate court bar association gilgit and president chief court bar association for assistance of the court as amicus curie. the advocate general gilgit baltistan (northern areas) has represented the chief secretary gilgit baltistan whereas the deputy attorney general for pakistan has filed written arguments comments on behalf of attorney general for pakistan. the judgment was reserved for the comments of the ka na (ka gb) division, government of pakistan which have not been filed. the learned amicus curie, the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned advocate general have rendered very valuable assistance to the court. having heard the learned counsel and learned amicus at length and given due consideration to the question of law and fats raised in this petition we have examined the matter in depth and have drawn the conclusion as under: the trade or a labour union cannot effectively function as a representative body in the industrial disputes between the workers and employers for protection of the rights of workers merely on the basis of provisions of article () of the constitution of pakistan read with article -a of northern areas governance order substituted by article of gilgit baltistan (empowerment and self governance) order without statutory recognition and thus the law on the industrial relations for effective enforcement of fundamental right of formation of union in gilgit baltistan and for regulating the industrial relations is to be provided with the application of related labour laws as mentioned in the petition. consequently for the reason to be given in detail judgment, we with the above declaration allow this petition and direct as under: subject to all just exceptions, until a permanent law regulating the industrial relations for protection of labour rights with reasonable restrictions is made for gilgit baltistan, the industrial relations act a temporary legislation with related labour laws as prayed in the petition will be enforced in gilgit baltistan (northern areas) which would deem to have been extended to gilgit baltistan (northern areas). the ka gb (ka na) division in the federal government will accordingly issue the formal notification for enforcement of these laws. pending announcement of short order, northern areas governance order was substituted with gilgit baltistan (empowerment and self governance) order with recognition of fundamental rights, referred in part ii chapter i of the constitution of pakistan and in article to article of part ii of gilgit baltistan (empowerment and self governance) order therefore for the28 page purpose of this judgment, northern areas governance order may be read as gilgit baltistan (empowerment and self governance) order the ministry of kashmir affairs and northern areas division in the federal government will take immediate steps for issue of notification for the extension of ir act with all other federal labour laws enforced in the country to northern areas with in one month failing which ira with enabling labour laws referred in the body of this judgment would be deemed to have been made applicable and would become operative in whole of gilgit baltistan. this petition with above declaration and direction is allowed with no order as to the costs. chief
