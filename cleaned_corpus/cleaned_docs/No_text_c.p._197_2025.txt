allowed on ... the said order was challenged by the respondent before the high court through fao no. of which was allowed vide the impugned judgment. hence, the present petition. heard both sides and the record perused. in view of the foregoing factual background, the present petition gives rise to the following questions of law for determination by this court: i. whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the high court correctly concluded that article of he act of is attracted only when a party to the arbitration applies to the court for filing of the award, and does not govern a request made by a party to the arbitrator for filing the award before the court. ii. whether under the scheme of the act of any period of limitation is prescribed page cpla no. of for an arbitrator or umpire when filing an award before the court. before adverting to the legal questions formulated hereinabove, it is considered appropriate to first reproduce article of the act of as follows: description of application period of limitation time from which period begins to run under the arbitration act, for the filing in court of an award ninety days the date of service of the notice of the making of the award. article of the act of is the primary provision that regulates the period within which proceedings may be instituted for making an award rule of the court. it prescribes a period of ninety days, running from the date on which notice of the making the award is served. where a party does not first request the arbitrator or umpire to file the award in court, it may directly approach the court and seek an order directing the arbitrator or umpire to file the award or a signed copy thereof. an application of this nature falls within the ambit of article of the act of provided that notice of the award has been served in terms of section () of the act of a different legal regime applies where no notice of the award has been served and the party merely requests the arbitrator, under section () of the act of to file the award in court. in such a situation, the residuary article of the act of becomes operative. article prescribes a period of three years commencing from the date when the right to apply accrues. in matters of arbitration, that right accrues when the award is made and the party obtains knowledge of it. article of the act of has no application where the award is filed by the arbitrator himself because he seeks no relief for his own benefit. service of notice upon the party is, therefore, a sine qua non for the applicability of article of page cpla no. of the act of and in the absence of such notice, the provision cannot be invoked. in the present case, the record clearly demonstrates that the respondent did not, at any material stage, file an application under section () of the act of seeking a direction from the court requiring the arbitrator to file the award. instead, it was the a rbitrator who, on .., filed the award before the district judge, islamabad, without any judicial direction compelling him to do so. in these circumstances, the essential preconditions for the applicability of article of the act of were not met, and the provision was erroneously invoked. in view of the discussion hereinabove, we conclude that on the facts and circumstances of the case, the high court rightly held that article of the act of applies only where a party to the arbitration proceedings applies to the court for filing of the award. it does not apply to an application made by the party to the arbitrator for filing the award, which would instead be governed by article of the act of in view of the foregoing, we hold that the impugned judgment of the high court is based on a correct analysis of facts and law. we find no legal infirmity the rein, warranting interference. accordingly, the present petition, along with the cma, is dismissed, and leave declined. no order as to costs. vide short order of even date, we dismissed this petition, and above are the reasons for the same. .. zia approved for reporting
