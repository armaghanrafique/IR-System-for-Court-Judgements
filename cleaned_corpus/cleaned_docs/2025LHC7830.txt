existence of complete and reasoned findings on merits in favour of the petitioners. conversely, learned counsel for the respondent supported the impugned judgment. arguments heard. record perused. before addressing the legality of the impugned judgment, it would be appropriate to briefly recapitulate the factual background and the reasoning recorded by the appellate court below, particularly in paragraph of the impugned judgment, which forms the foundation of the impugned decision. the respondent instituted a suit for specific performance of contract on the basis of an affidavit dated .. against the petitioner and proforma respondent no. an the suit was contested. issues were framed and evidence was recorded. the trial court dismissed the suit with the categorical finding that the respondent had failed to prove the execution of the alleged affidavit. aggrieved thereof, the respondent referred an appeal, which culminated in to the impugned judgment. in doing so, the appellate court below recorded the respective submissions of the parties in paragraphs and of its judgment. paragraph reads as under: today the appeal in hand was fixe for final arguments. during course of arguments, the learned counsel for respondent pointed out that the learned trial court has not framed any issue on point of limitation whereas respondent specifically raised the objection on limitation and he reque sted that case be remanded for framing of issue on point of limitation and deciding the case while keeping in view the point of limitation as well. page c.r. no. of paragraph reads as follows: whereas on the other hand learned counsel for appellant argued that there arises no need to frame issue upon the point of limitation as the suit of the appellant is within limitation according to affidavit agreement to sell therefore, case be decided on merits without taking into account the point of limitation. a caref ul examination of the record, when juxtaposed with the findings returned by the trial court, makes it abundantly clear that there was no rational basis for the petitioner —who had succeeded on merits before the trial court —to seek a remand on the question of limitation. more importantly, the record unmistakably reflects that it was the respondent themselves, being the plaintiff before the trial court, who were pressing for a decision on merits by the appellate court below rather than a remand of the matte for decision on question of limitation. in fact, the respondent insisted that their suit was not time barred. the impugned findings of the appellate court below, therefore, suffer from internal inconsistency, are not borne out from the record, and stand in direct contradiction to the respondent stated position. upon a specific query by this court, learned counsel for the respondent was unable to controvert the factual position emerging from the record. this court is of the opinion that an order of remand is not to be passed as a matter of course. an appellate court is duty -bound to examine whether such a course would meaningfully advance the cause of in the present case, findings on merits already stand rec orded against the respondent after a full trial. a remand, in such circumstances, would only subject the parties to another round of avoidable proceedings. even if the issue of limitation was to be decided in favour of the respondents, the ir suit would no netheless require adjudication on merits on the basis of evidence —an exercise already page c.r. no. of undertaken by the trial court. the appropriate course, therefore, was reappraisal of the evidence by the appellate court below itself rather than a remand. the appellate court below failed to appreciate that the remand ordered by it would serve no useful purpose and would, instead, defeat the objective of expeditious justice. in view of the foregoing discussion, this petition is allowed. the impugned .. is set aside. resultantly, the appeal preferred by the respondent shall be deemed to be pending before the appellate court below, which shall summon the parties, afford them an opportunity of hearing, and decide the same afresh, in accordance wit law.
