however, the record reflects that muhammad riaz himself allegedly refused to accept the service of notice, hence, his service was defective and partial pre -emption cannot be allowed. adds that there exist material contradictions in the testimony of the pws inasmuch as muhammad nawaz (pw -), statedly informed the respondent pre-emptor immediately about the sale when the informer arrived in the gathering, whereas other pws stated that initially, gener al social discussion took place in a gathering before the factum of sale was communicated to the participants, including the respondent pre-emptor. further ontends that there are contradictions regarding the issuance of notices of talb-i-ishhad: whil one notice and five copies were statedly dispatched, pws contended that six separate notices were prepared. this, it is argued, affects the credibility of the respondent pre-emptor witnesses. further argued that the postmaster (pw -) reported service of no tices to all the petitioner and the refusal thereof, but the report of service was not confronted to dw-, namely, muhammad bashir who is petitioner no., and that only one of six copies of the notices was produced in evidence, raising serious doubts regarding completeness of issuance of notice of talb-i-ishhad. in support of his contentions, learned counsel for the petitioner places reliance on cases reported as javaid iqbal v. abdul aziz and another (pld sc and muhammad intizar hussain v. mu hammad iqbal ylr ). conversely, earned counsel for the respondent pre-emptor contends that all petitioners, including the purported minor petitioner no., refused to accept the notice. adds that the petitioner no. was in fact major, a fact corroborated by his signature on the written statement. it is argued that there is no legal requirement for all purchasers under a single registered deed to be individually served for the purpose of talb-i-ishhad to be valid and a photo copy of notic is page c.r no. valid, reliance being placed on case reported as shoukat hayat v. liaquat khan ylr ). learned counsel further contends that all six notices were duly thumb -marked, and sent by the respondent pre-emptor and the notices and receipts were brought record as exh.p to exh.p and exh.p to exh.p -, respectively. a cross objection has been raised that sale price was exaggerated and instead of actual sale price of rs., -, amount of rs.,, was mentioned in the sale deed just to frustrate the right of pre -emption of the respondent pre -emptor. in rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioner averred that verbal cross objection can not be raised at the revisional stage. arguments heard. record perused. the points for determi natio before this court are as follows: i. whether, in the context of the special and stringent requirements of the law of pre -emption, the registration of a sale deed must be treated as notice so as to deem the pre -emptor to have acquired knowledge rom he date of registration; or whether the statute requires proof of actual knowledge, regardless of whether the transaction was effected through a registered document, an unregistered document, or an oral sale? ii. whether the respondent pre -emptor validly performed talb-i-ishhad in accordance with the mandatory requirements of the act, particularly regarding service of notices upon all six petitioners? iii. whether the alleged defects in service —such as the use of photo copy of a notice, alleged non service upon muhammad riaz asserted as minor), and refusal —render the talb-i-ishhad invalid? iv. whether contradictions in the testimony of the pre-emptor witnesses regarding the timing and manner of the informer disclosure about sale undermine the cred ibility of the respondent pre- emptor case? page c.r no. v. whether verbal cross objections can be raised, at the revisional stage? taking up the first legal question that registration of the sale deed constitutes public notice and same is sufficient to trigger the making of talb-i-muwathibat, without actual knowledge of the respondent pre -emptor, this court is of the opinion that the same is untenable in the framework of the pre -emption law. the act is a special statute, and the obligations created therein —particular ly those relating to the talbs demands —are independent, rigid, and strictly construed. the act and the jurisprudence developed thereof does not incorporate the doctrine of constructive notice nor does it equate registration (of the sale) with the actu al knowledge of the pre -emptor for the purpose of triggering time for raising talb-i-muwathibat. the argument of learned counsel for the petitioner overlooks the explicit framework prescribed under section of the act, which contemplates a period of months for the purpose of institution of the pre -emption suit and the date of registration of sale deed is the deemed knowledge and or triggering point for the purpose of commuting the aid period only; said date cannot be extended or treated as knowledge or th purpose of making talab -i-muwathibat inasmuch as he legislature, despite being fully aware of the nature of registered documents, has consciously refrained from prescribing that registration (of sale) shall be deemed knowledge of the respondent pre-emptor. the statutory scheme makes the actual acquisition of knowledge the determinative factor, not the availability of the document on the public record. introducing the doctrine of constructive or deemed knowledge, for the purpose of making talb-i-muwathib at, would effectively rewrite the pre-emption law and make the requirements even more stringent, which is impermissible. thus, for purpose of exercise of talb-i-muwathibat, the plea that registration of sale deems to be public notice and therefore, within knowledge of the pre -emptor cannot sustain. page c.r no. accordingly, no adverse inference can be drawn solely from the fact that the sale deed was registered and the respondent pre -emptor raised talb-i-muwathibat after three and half months, from the date of registration of the sale deed. adverting to the point of determination at serial nos.ii to iv of para supra, which are intertwined, it is noted that he evidence establishes that the petitioner are real brothers, all of whom purchased the suit property throu gh a single registered sale deed. the purchase was made collectively, and the parties acted together in protecting their mutual interests as only petitioner no. appeared as dw -, on behalf of all petitioners. nowhere the objection was taken that peti tione no., namely, muhammad riaz was a minor and report of his refusal to accept notice was false and fabricated. hence, mere fact that petitioner no., namely, muhammad riaz was taken as a minor by the respondent pre -emptor loses its significant when th pet itioners never denied that in fact at the time of sale, as also issuance of notice of talb- i-ishhad, said petitioner no. was in fact major and, therefore, his refusal to accept notice meets the requirements of the act. the respondent pre-emptor prepar ed six notices (ex.p to ex.p -) with signatures and thumb impressions of himself and witnesses, including the scribe (pw -). these notices were dispatched on .. through registered envelopes (ex.p to ex.p -) to the petitioner defendants. the postmaster (pw -) confirmed that the petitioner refused to receive the notices envelopes, returning the originals along with reports of refusal (ex.p to ex.p ). all notices, whether original or five copies, bore the signatures and thumb impressions of the respondent pre-emptor and witnesses, together with the scribe seal and signature. these facts establish that the talb-i-ishhad was validly performed in accordance with the law. thus, the petitioner objection —that the respondent pre-emptor page c.r no. claimed to have prepared one notice and made five copies, whereas pws stated that separate six notices were prepared —carries no weight in view of the dicta laid down in case of shoukat hayat supra wherein it has been held as under: .. the responde nt wh ile in the witness -box as p.w. stated that after preparing the original notice its photostat copy was prepared which was signed by him and the other two witnesses (p.w. and p.w.). this notice was received in evidence as exh.p.. both the other witn esses p.ws. and have categorically stated that they signed exh.p.. photostat copy of the notice carrying the original signatures of the respondent and that of the witness shall be considered as original document in terms of provisions of articles an of qanun -e- shahadat order, despatch of notice of talb -i- ishhad is proved through postal receipt exh.p., duly proved by p.w. which under ordinary course of events, shall be presumed to have reached the destination and distributed to petitioner as deposed by p.w. in terms of article qanun -e-shahadat order, signatures on receipt exh.p. (a.d.) and those on written statement of the petitioner, do not only resemble to each other but are by one person thus delivery of notice exh.p. to etitioner is proved to the hilt. (emphasis supplied the petitioner side argued that contradictions exist in the testimony of the respondent pre-emptor witnesses regarding the timing and manner of information provided by muhammad nawaz (pw-) and the preparation of notices. pw (respondent pre- emptor ), pw -, and pw consistently stated that muhammad nawaz informed the respondent pre-emptor about the sale on .. at p.m., following which the respondent pre -emptor promptly expr essed his intention to pre -empt. minor variations that there was general discussion at the gathering and later on information of sale was imparted or otherwise do not materially affect the credibility of the witnesses as there was no alleged hesitation eve of a minute on part of the respondent pre -emptor to raise talb-i- page c.r no. muwathibat when the information about sale was imparted by the informer. moreover, pw- confirmed that the notices were prepared on .. and sent through registered post with acknow ledgm ent due, supported by postal receipts (ex.p to ex.p -). the record shows that all such evidence —original envelopes, postal receipts (ex.p to ex.p -), reports of refusal (ex.p to ex.p ), and notices (ex.p to ex.p -)—was produced, examin ed, a nd admitted in accordance with law. this evidence corroborates the oral testimony regarding talb-i-ishhad, and the courts below rightly relied upon it. it was essential for the respondent pre-emptor to prove the issuance of notices under talb-i-ishhad and to adduce the testimony of the postmaster or postal official who effected the service, including proof of refusal by the purchasers defendants, as the entire chain of steps is designed to ensure that no link in this statutory sequence remains missing. upon review of the evidentiary resume of the present case, this court finds that the statutory chain stands fully established. the requirements are undoubtedly stringent, but the respondent pre- emptor has succeeded in proving each component in its letter and spirit. consequently, this court is of the considered view that the respondent pre-emptor validly exercised his right of pre -emption, and both the courts below were justified in decreeing the suit. regarding the cross -objections raised verbally by the respondent pre-emptor at the revisional stage, it is noted that written cross -objections were filed at the appellate stage regarding the sale price, however, the absence of formal filing of cross objections, at the revisional stage, limits the respond ent pre-emptor ability to expand the scope of issues before this court. the raising of verbal objections at the revisional stage is a course that ought to be discouraged, as the procedural framework emphasizes formal pleadings and clearly articulated gro unds. even where such verbal objections are to be allowed, the first and essential consideration is whether the point page c.r no. sought to be raised has the effect of altering, varying, or undermining the decree itself. if the verbal cross objection merely touches up on an evidentiary aspect, without disturbing the decree as maintained by the court (s) below, there may be little procedural objection to entertaining such a verbal submission, at the revisional stage. however, where the objection introduces a material chan ge th at would effectively rewrite or modify the decree, the revisional forum is not the appropriate stage for reopening such matters. viewed from this angle, verbal cross objection relating to the sale price tends toward a substantive alteration of the dec ree, as this issue was decided against the respondent pre -emptor, which calls for a more formal course than what can be achieved through verbal submissions alone at this stage. more -so, when the respondent pre-emptor failed to produce credible evidence to prove the actual sale consideration of rs., before the courts below as no documentary evidence or market comparables were presented. in the absence of such proof, the sale price of rs.,, recorded in the sale deed (ex.d -) must be presumed corre ct. in view of the foregoing discussion, the concurrent findings of the courts below are accordingly upheld. accordingly, he petition is dismissed with costs.
