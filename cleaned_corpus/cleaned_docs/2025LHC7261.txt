(aamer associates, etc. v. audit oversight board, etc. or pic, audits were conducted in good faith, the violations were inadvertent, and no harm was caused to stakeholders. it further argued that the penalty was excessive and disproportionate given the circumstances, including its status as a small firm and its volun tary resignation from the audit engagement. learned counsel for the appellant submits that appellant no. is a duly registered chartered accountants firm with the institute of chartered accountants of pakistan (icap), while appellant no. is its sole proprietor and a qualified chartered accountant. the appellant accepted the audit engagements of mtra for the financial years ending june and in good faith and in accordance with professional standards. it is urged that upon recei ving a notice dated april from the respondent seeking information regarding audits of public interest companies, the appellant promptly provided the requested details on may thereby demonstrating cooperation and transparency. counsel arg ues that despite this conduct, respondent no. issued a show cause notice dated december alleging unauthorized auditing of a pic. the appellant submitted a detailed reply dated december controverting all allegations, yet the respondent aob proceeded to impose a penalty of rs. and reprimands the firm in respect of violation and to ensure compliance as per law in future, through its april after a hearing conducted via zoom. it is contended that the penalty is exorbitant, unjustified, and disproportionate, especially given that the audits were performed in good faith without mala fide intent. it is further urged that the representation filed under regulation of the aob regulations was dismissed vide order date july in a cursory manner, without addressing key objections raised by the appellants. in particular, serious challenge was mounted to the constitution of the grievance committee. it is submitted that the same members who passed the original order also sat on the committee deciding the representation. such an arrangement, according to page commercial appeal no. (aamer associates, etc. v. audit oversight board, etc. counsel, strikes at the very root of impartial adjudication and offends the principle of nemo judex in causa sua, no one can be a reliance is placed on the settled jurisprudence that even the likelihood of bias vitiates proceedings, let alone actual bias. learned counsel further argues that the intent of regulation is to provide an efficacious remedy by allowing a person aggrieved by an order of the aob to seek reconsideration before the chairman. the provision loses its meaning if the same bench which passed the order is reconstituted to decide the representation against its own order. it is submitted that the chairman ought to have either per sonally heard the representation or formed a committee excluding the original members. failure to do so constitutes grave procedural illegality rendering the impugned order void. on the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent supports the impugn ed orders, contending that the firm admittedly conducted audits of mtra without registration with the aob, thereby violating clear provisions of law. it is argued that ignorance of law cannot be pleaded, and the penalty imposed is within the statutory framework. it is further contended that the representation was duly heard and dismissed, and that the constitution of the committee does not amount to bias in law since the matter was dealt with collectively and in good faith. arguments heard. record perused. now adverting to the merits of the case, here a decision was made by aob under section and cc read with regulations and may file a representation with the chairman within days. the chairman or the committee constituted by hi would decide the representation. there is no dispute among the parties that the decision on the representation may set aside that order subject matter of representation. thus, it was not an illusionary remedy but an internal review for all intents and pu rposes. so, a decision that is subject to representation necessarily entails the possibility that the committee may either affirm or vary the decision under challenge. now, the four member who decided the case at first instance were also members of page commercial appeal no. (aamer associates, etc. v. audit oversight board, etc. the com mittee constituted by the chairman under regulation of the ibid regulations which decided the representation. it is impermissible for a decision -maker to hear an appeal or a challenge to their own decision. where a single decision is taken in multiple stages, however, the same decision -maker may, depending on the circumstances, be permitted to act at more than one stage. in r. (on the application of hofstetter brent lbc, for instance, the high court dismi ssed a challenge to a decision by a local authority officer to affirm their earlier decision to rescind an applicant's approval to adopt a child. the relevant regulations supported the conclusion that stages subsequent the initial determination were in the nature of a review, not an appeal and the process required the officer to take account of th recommendation of an independ ent review panel. where, however, an interim or initial decision is expressed in terms that would lead the fair -minded and informed observer to conclude there is a real possibility the decision -maker will not be prepared to change their mind, they should not participate in subsequent stages of decision -making. the sup reme court of pakistan4 observed this foundational principle of natural -availability of the competent tribunal or court can hear but the chairman in the instan case could have made a committee larger than four members excluding the member who already have decided the case. thus, the committee which decided the representation should not have included those members who decided the case at first instance. the fou member who had expressed their mind and view about work and conduct of appellant, therefore, to re -approach them for simply fulfilling e.g. r.
