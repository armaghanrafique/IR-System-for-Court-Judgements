(dost muhammad khan), his legal heirs shall be impleaded as respondent and if so whether charge is required to be framed against them or otherwise? page criminal petition no. of vide .. impugned order ), the high court, besides, answering the aforesaid question also decided the legal point with regard to enhancement of sentence of the deceased respondent no. as well as the issue of return of possession or determination of right regarding the land in question as unde r:- so far as enhancement of sentence of respondent no. is concerned, he has admitted ly died and is no more a living person. the appeal to his extent stands abated. impleadment of his legal heirs shall make no difference as sentence of respondent no. cannot be practically enhanced. the question of return of possession or determination of rights with regard to immovable property is not falling within the purview of instant appeal. request of learned counsel for the appellant for impleadment of legal heirs of respondent no., is therefore, misconceived we have heard the learned counsel for the parties at some length and have also examined the record as well as the impugned order with their able assistance. since, from the available record, this court was not in a position to ascertain whether convict -respondent no. had questioned his conviction and sentence before the learned high court, the office of the additional registrar (judicial), peshawar high court, abbottabad bench, was contacted for requisite information. the said office duly furnished the necessary particulars, according to which the convict -respondent no. had also preferred criminal appeal no. -a of against his conviction and sentence. however, the said appeal stood abated and was dismissed on account of his demise vide ... the information so received further reveals that criminal appeal no. -a of filed by the present petitioner -complainant at present has been adjourned sine die due to the pendency of the instant criminal petition before this court. it is a matter of record that upon the death of convict respondent no., both appeals stood abated to the extent of conviction of the respondent no., as contemplated under section of the code of criminal procedure, the code ). however, it is significant to note that while recording the conviction of the deceased respondent no., the learned trial court had also directed him to hand over possession of the land in question to the petitioner -complainant. in this view of the matter, the main question for consideration before us would be as to what would be the fate of the appeal filed by the respondent -convict to the extent of page criminal petition no. of order of the trial court regarding delivery restoration of possession of the land in question to the petitioner -complainant. it is to be observed that, at the inception of the act of no statutory right of appeal was provided to the parties. the legislative scheme was subsequently altered through the insertion of section -a by way of the amendment in the year whereby a substantive right of appeal was introduced by insertion of section -a in the act of against any order passed under sections sub-section () and () and section () of the act of such appeal lies before the high court and is required to be instituted within thirty days of the impugned order of the trial court. for ready reference section -a of the act of is reproduced below: -a.appeal: any order made under sub -section() and sub section() of section and sub -section() of section shall, within thirty days of the order, be appeal -able before the high court. under section of the act of the provisions of the code, have been made applicable to the proceedings under the act of and section of the code governs the abatement of appeal on the death of the accused except from a sentence of fine. for ready reference section, of the code is reproduced below: section every appeal under section -a, sub -section (), or section shall finally abate on the death of the accused, and every other appeal under this chapter (except an appeal from a sentence of fine) shall finally abate on the death of the appellant. bare reading of section of the code would reveal that the same is conspicuously silent regarding the fate of an appeal where, in addition to the sentence of imprisonment, the accused -convict has also been directed to restore or hand over possession of the property to the complainant. it does not contemplate, nor does it regulate, a situation where the convict, besides suffering conviction, has also been subjected to a civil -consequence order regarding restoration of possession of the property. the said lacuna has been addressed through section -a of the act of which for the sake of convenience and ready reference is reproduced below: delivery of property to owner, etc. —() on conclusion of the trial, if the court finds that an owner or occupier of the property was illegally dispossessed or the property was grabbed in contravention of section the court may, at the time of passing an order under sub -sections () and () of that section, direct the accused or any person claiming through him to restore possession of the property to the owner or, as the case may be, to the occupier, if such possession has not already been restored under section page criminal petition no. of the mandate of section -a read with section () of the act of makes it evident that an appeal challenging an order of restoration of possession survives independently of the personal criminal liability of the accused. such order imposes obligations not only upon the accused but also upon any person claiming through him. consequently, the death of the convict does not extinguish the controversy regarding possession of the property. while the penal aspect of the appeal abates under section of the code, the appeal does not abate to the extent that it assails the civil -consequence direction for restoration of possession under section (). to hold otherwise would defeat the very object and purpose of the act of which is a special law enacted for the protection of lawful owners against illegal dispossession and the restoration of property to them. accordingly, section -a of the act of appropriately caters to the situation where the convict -appellant dies pending appeal. the abatement is confined to the portion relatable to his sentence; the appeal, however, survives and remains maintainable to the extent of the order regarding delivery or restoration of possession, which the appellate court is competent to adjudicate on merits notwithstanding the demise of the convict. it is a well -entrenched and consistently followed principle of statutory interpretation that a special law overrides the general law. reference may be made to the judgment of this court rendered in case titled, sngpl sk private limited scmr ). where the legislature, in its wisdom, enacts a special statute to address a particular mischief or to provide a distinct procedural or substantive framework, such special enactment must prevail in the event of any inconsistency or overlap with the general law. this rule, grounded in the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant, has repeatedly been affirmed by this court. examined in this perspective, act of is a special enactment designed to curb the menace of land -grabbing and illegal dispossession, and to ensure expeditious restoration of possession to the lawful owner. the scheme of the act of is self -contained and reflects a legislative intent to depart, wherever necessary, from the ordinary criminal procedure embodied in the code. indeed, section of the act of renders the provisions of the code applicable only insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the act of hereby acknowledging the primacy of the latter. page criminal petition no. of accordingly, in circumstances where the code is either silent or its provisions do not fully address the consequences arising under the act of the special statutory framework must govern. the introduction of section -a through the amendment is a clear manifestation of the legislature intention to provide an independent and comprehensive appellate mechanism in respect of orders passed under sections () and (), and section () of the act of the purpose was to ensure that the remedial objectives of the act, particularly the restoration of possession, are not frustrated by procedural lacunae in the general criminal law. the act of being a special law with its own remedial purpose, must prevail. the abatement under section is confined to the penal aspect of the matter; it does not, and cannot, divest the appellate forum of jurisdiction to examine the legality and propriety of an order passed under section () concerning restoration of possession, a matter that extends beyond the personal culpability of the deceased convict and directly affects proprietary rights. therefore, applying the settled principle that the special law overrides the general, the provisions of the act of must be given full effect in preference to the general provisions of the code wherever the two intersect. consequently, the appeal survives to the extent of the civil -consequence direction for restoration of possession, notwithstanding the demise of the convict appellant. for the reasons discussed hereinabove, this petition is converted into an appeal and disposed of in the terms that the impugned .. of the learned high court, passed in criminal appeal no. -a of to the extent of dismissal of prayer of the petitioner convict for enhancement of sentence of the convict -respondent no., is upheld, while to the extent of dismissal of the prayer of the petitioner complainant in respect of restoration of possession of the land in question, is set-aside. it is necessary to clarify that cr.a. no. -a of against acquittal of respondent no. to is still pending and has been adjourned sine die, which shall be resurrected and fixed for hearing on receipt of this order. criminal appeal no. -a of filed by convict -appellant dost muhammad khan deceased and abated on his death vide .., is restored but only to the extent of the determination of question relating to possession of the land in question and to that extent order of the high court dated .. is set aside. page criminal petition no. of the learned high court while deciding cr.a. no. -a of to the extent of acquittal of respondent no. to along with cr.a. no. -a of shall also determine the issue pertaining to restoration of possession of the property in question. in doing so, the legal heirs of the deceased respondent no. shall be afforded a fair and adequate opportunity of hearing in accordance with law. .. approved for reporting. m.siraj afridi ps
