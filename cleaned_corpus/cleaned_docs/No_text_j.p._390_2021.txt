through the instant jail petition, the petitioner -convict seeks leave to the impugned judgment of the high court. it is a case of sexual abuse of a minor victim boy of years, namely, muhammad shahvaiz. in cases of a like nature, the testimony of the victim is given much importance and conviction can be recorded on the sole testimony of the victim provided the same is supported by medical evidence. the victim of this case, namely muhammad shah vaiz, appeared before the trial court in the witness box as pw -. being a child at the relevant time, the trial court, prior to recording his statement, put certain questions to him, which he answered rationally. in his statement, the minor victim deposed that on .., he, along with his cousin, went to a park, where a boy approached him and promised to give him a kite, kite thread, and marbles (bantay). on this pretext, he took him to an under -construction shop in street no., where he was forcibly subjected to sexual intercourse. he further deposed that upon returning home, he narrated the incident to his mother, who immediately took him to the police station where the matter was reported. the minor victim stated that he was medically examined by a doctor and that he identified the petitioner -convict during an page jail petition no. of identification parade conducted inside the jail. during cross examination, the minor victim reiterated that he had identified the petitioner -convict inside adyala jail and that no police officer had pointed out the petitioner to him. no beneficial inference for the defence, nor any adverse fact for the prosecution, could be elicited from the victim during cross -examination. the identification parade of the petitioner -convict was conducted on .. by (pw -) through the minor victim, muhammad shah vaiz. pw deposed that after complying with all legal formalities, he conducted the identification parade of the petitioner inside adyala jail. during the parade, the minor victim correctly identified the petitioner -convict and specifically narrated the role of the petitioner, reiterating the mode and manner in which he was subjected to unnatural offence. the identification parade report was tendered in evidence by pw and marked as exh.pj (exh.pd). pw- was cross examined, but nothing could be elicited to discredit the identification proceedings or to cast doubt on the correctness of the victim identification. it is well -settled that identification of an accused by the victim is a piece of substantive evidence and has great evidentiary value, particularly in cases where the offence is committed in private and there are no other eyewitnesses. admittedly, a correct identification, especially by a victim who had the opportunity to observe the culprit during the commission of the offence, is of utmost significance and cannot be lightly discarded. in the present case, the minor victim identification of the petitioner -convict inside the jail, without any prompting by the police, carries substantial weight and reinforces the credibility of his testimony. on the very day of the occurrence, the minor victim was medically examined by dr. komal yousaf sandhu (pw -). in her deposition, she stated that upon examination she observed scratch marks on both sides of the victim neck. she further stated that the anal swabs of the victim were obtained by the surgery department, sealed, and handed over to the police for analysis by the pfsa. the victim was thereafter referred to dr. zulfiqar khan tanoli (pw-). according to his testimony, upon clinical examination he noted scratch marks on both sides of the victim neck just below the jawline, as well as visible bruises in the perianal region, accompanied by fissures at the and clock positions, though without active bleeding. on arrest of the petitioner -convict, he was produced before dr. nirmal (pw -) on .., who obtained his blood sample for dna analysis and subsequently referred him to page jail petition no. of dr. amir abbas, urologist (pw -). as per the statement of pw -, upon medical examination the petitioner -convict was found to be capable of performing sexual intercourse. mehdi khan asi (pw -) took into possession the clothes of the victim, including his trousers bearing semen stains, and deposited the same in the pfsa on .. along with the dna blood sample of the victim. the blood samples of the petitioner -convict, obtained by the medical officer, were handed over to rafaqat hussain asi (pw -), who deposited them in the pfsa lahore on ... according to the pfsa report exh.pk, seminal material was detected on the stained section of the victim trousers. furthermore, as per pfsa report exh.pl, the dna profile developed from the sperm fraction of the trousers matched the dna profile obtained from the blood sample of the petitioner -convict. the buccal swab standard of the victim also matched correspondingly, thus eliminating any possibility of contamination or error. the pfsa reports exh.pk and exh.pl provide strong forensic corroboration of the minor victim account, conclusively connecting the petitioner -convict with the commission of the offence. mst. naveeda shaheen, the mother of the victim, appeared as pw-. in her statement she has also charged the petitioner -convict for commission of the offence. she deposed that immediately after the occurrence, her minor son narrated the entire occurrence. she has faithfully reproduced before the court the facts as disclosed to her victim son at the first available opportunity and she reported the same to the police. her statement, being contemporaneous with the occurrence and forming part of the same transaction, squarely falls within the ambit of the doctrine of res gestae and is, therefore, admissible in evidence under article of the qanun -e-shahadat order, which for ready reference is reproduced below: relevancy of facts forming part of same transaction: facts which though not in issue are so connected with a fact in issue as to form part of the same transaction, are relevant, whether they occurred at the same time and place or at different time and places the law is well -settled that a spontaneous and contemporaneous declaration made by a victim or witness, without affording any opportunity for reflection, tutoring, or fabrication, carries a high degree of intrinsic reliability and is receivable as an exception to the general rule against hearsay. in the present case, the victim, a minor boy of about eight years of age, returned home within half an hour of the occurrence and immediately narrated the incident to his mother. a child of such page jail petition no. of tender years cannot reasonably be expected to devise or tailor a concocted story within such a short span of time. his narration, therefore, bears the hallmark of truth and spontaneity. the doctrine of res gestae, literally meaning things done, constitutes a recognized exception to the inadmissibility of hearsay. our courts have consistently accepted statements falling within this doctrine when the following conditions are fulfilled (i) the statement must be made at or immediately after the occurrence, leaving no room for deliberation, invention, or external influence. it must arise instinctively and naturally from the event itself; and (ii) the statement must form an integral part of the same transaction, being so closely interconnected in time, place, and circumstance that it becomes inseparable from the occurrence. the underlying rationale is that such utterances, made under the stress and excitement of the event, possess a degree of reliability that excludes the likelihood of fabrication. these spontaneous declarations illuminate the nature, character, and context of the incident and thereby assist the court in arriving at the truth. for what has been discussed hereinabove, we are satisfied that the concurrent findings recorded by the courts below rest upon a proper and meticulous appreciation of the evidence as well as the applicable law. both the trial court and the high court a ppellate court have correctly evaluated the material brought on the record and, on the basis thereof, have rightly concluded that the petitioner -convict is guilty of the offence charged. we find no illegality, perversity, or jurisdictional defect in the impugned judgment. likewise, no instance of misreading, non -reading, or improper appraisal of evidence has been pointed out that may justify interference by this court in the exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction. the conclusions drawn by the courts below are well -reasoned, supported by the evidence, and call for no indulgence. consequently, the petition is devoid of merit and is hereby dismissed. leave is refused. approved for reporting. m.siraj afridi ps page jail petition no. of
