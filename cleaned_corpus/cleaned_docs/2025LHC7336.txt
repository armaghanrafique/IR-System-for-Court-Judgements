order, remedy of review is available. the question before this court is as to whether in the light of availability of remedy of review, this court can remit the matter to the board of revenue with the direction to treat it as review in terms of section of the act, it is an oft -repeated principle of law that no fetters can be imposed upon the powers of the high court or the supreme court to convert and treat one type of proceeding into another and to ecide the same subject to jurisdiction or to remit the lis to the competent page w.p.no. of authority forum court for decision on merits. reliance to this effect can be placed on mian asghar ali government of punjab through secretary (colonies) bor, lahore and othe rs scmr ). relevant excerpt from the same is reproduced below: power to convert and or treat one kind of proceeding into another is derived from authority to do ex debito justitiae, which always existed and have always been exercised by the court not only to advance the cause of no fetters or bar could be placed on the high court and or this court to convert and treat one type of proceeding into another and proceed to decide the matter either itself provided it has jurisdiction over the lis that has fallen on its lap for adjudication in exercise of another jurisdiction vested in the very court or may remit the lis to the court forum authorit of competent jurisdiction for decision of the lis on its own merits. courts have been treating and or converting appeal into revisions and vice versa and constitution petitions into appeal or revision and vice versa. in the case of jane margrete william v. abdul hamid mian scmr ), c.m.a. under section c.p.c. filed in the high court, was treated as cross objection. in the case of capital development authority v. khuda bakhsh and others scmr ), where the high court converted the c. m.a. filed in a disposed off writ petition as a separate writ petition and decided the same accordingly, this court held if the high court was satisfied that circumstances of the case justified conversion of miscellaneous application filed by the responden in a disposed off case into proceedings under article of the constitution of pakistan, there is no legal bar to such conversion of proceedings. even objection as to non-issuance of notice before such conversion, was not considered fatal by this court. even time consumed pursuing remedy before a wrong forum or jurisdiction in appropriate cases is condoned (see shamsul haq and others v. mst. ghoti and others scmr ). in a case cited as muhammad anis and others v. abdul haseeb and others (pld supreme court ); eligibility for consideration of promotion; was successfully challenged in writ jurisdiction of the high court. on appeal, this court came to a conclusion that such question falls within the competence of service tribunal, therefor e, writ is not maintainable. consequently impugned judgment the high court in exercise of writ jurisdiction was set aside and in paragraph of the judgment supra this court treated the writ petition as service appeal pending before the service tribunal with direction to decide the same after notice to the parties concerned in accordance with law. in similar circumstances in a judgment recently reported as province of sindh and another v. muhammad ilyas and others scmr dismissal from service order was challenged before the learned sindh high court through constitution petition. the constitutional petition was treated by the high court as service appeal and sent to the service tribunal; which was decided by the service tribunal on merit and this court declined leave in the matter. similar course was followed by the learned division bench of peshawar high court in a case reported as engineer musharaf shah v. government of khyber pakhtunkhwa page w.p.no. of through chief secretary and others plc (c.s.) ). in the cases reported as the thal engineering industries. ltd. v. the bank of bahawalpur ltd. and another scmr ), karamat hussain and others v. muhammad zaman and others (pld supreme court and capital development authority (sup ra) similar course was followed. reference to above effect can also be made to the case of hafsa habib qureshi and others amir hamza and others (pld supreme court ), wherein the supreme court of pakistan has held as under: besides, the high court has the power to conver and treat one type of proceeding into another type. after doing so, it can proceed to decide the matter itself, provided it has jurisdiction over the issue, or it may remit the matter to the competent authority, forum, or court for a decision on its merits. reference in this regard may be made to the cases of muhammad akram v. dco, rahim yar khan and others scmr ); sher alam khan v. abdul munim and others (pld supreme court ); and the commissioner of incom tax (legal) to, abbottabad v. messrs ed -zublin ag germany and another scmr ). law to this effect is also well settled that no party can be vexed on account of act of the court. no individual should bear any detriment arising from the cour error, and no act of the court should operate to anyone disadvantage. this doctrine embodies the wider basis essential for the fair and proper administration of justice. it is further linked to the principle that the court is obligated to remedy any harm caused to a party by its own actions. this well -known principle is founded on maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit (an act of the court shall prejudice no man). reference to this effect can be made to muhammad ijaz and another muhammad shafi through l.rs. scmr and general (retd.) pervez musharraf federation of pakistan and others scmr ). in somewhat similar facts and circumstances, in the case of abid jan ministry of defence through secretary, islamabad and others scmr ), supreme court of pakistan ruled as under: in the case of muhammad akram v. dco, rahim yar khan and others scmr ), an identical controversy was dilated upon by this court and it was held that no fetters or bar could be placed on the high court and or this court to convert and treat one type of page w.p.no. of proceedings into another type into another and proceed to decide the matter either itself, provided it has jurisdiction over the lis before it in exercise of another jurisdiction vested in the very court or may remit the lis to the competent authority forum or court for decision on merits. it was further held that once the writ petition which was filed within the period of limitation as provided for the departmental appeal, was treated and remitted by the high court as departmental appeal, that too where the limitation by then had not run out as noted above, therefore the learned punjab services tribunal had fallen into error to dismiss the appeal before it on the ground of limitation alone, without adverting to the merits of the case and as a consequence of these findings, this court had set aside the punjab services tribunal order and remanded the matter with the direction to decide the pending a ppeal on merits. in the next case of abdul qadoos v. commandant frontier constabulary, kpk, peshawar and another scmr ), a similar controversy was adverted to by this court keeping in mind the doctrine of ex debito justitiae which refers to the re medies to which a person is entitled to as of right, as opposed to a remedy which is discretionary. every court has the power to rectify ex debito justitiae its judgment and order to prevent abuse of process and severe patent oversights and mistakes. this power is an inherent power of the court to fix the procedural errors if arising from the court's own omission or oversight which resulted in a violation of the principles of natural in this case also the high court, in order to avoi a grave injustice and the rigors of technicalities, remitted the matter to the fst but the fst dismissed the appeal on the ground of limitation and in similar circumstances, the matter was remanded back to the service tribunal to decide the appeal on mer its. this court in the case of government of the punjab, through secretary, schools education department, lahore and others v. abdur rehman and others scmr ), held that the lexicons of law provide the definition of the legal maxim "ex debito justit iae" (latin) "as a matter of right or what a person is entitled to as of right". this maxim applies to the remedies that the court is bound to give when they are claimed as distinct from those that it has discretion to grant and no doubt the power of a court to act ex debito justitiae is an inherent power of courts to fix the procedural errors if arising from courts own omission or oversight which resulted violation of the principle of natural it is the foremost duty of the cour and tribunal to do complete justice. a patent and obvious error or oversight on the part of court in any order or decision may be reviewed sanguine to the renowned legal maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit ", which is a well -settled enunciation and artic ulation of law expressing that no man should suffer because of the fault of the court, or that an page w.p.no. of act of the court shall prejudice no one, and this principle also denotes the extensive pathway for the safe administration of justice. it is interrelated and intertwined with the state of affairs where the court is under an obligation to reverse the wrong done to a party by the act of court which is an elementary doctrine and tenet to the system of administration of this is a de rigueur sense of duty in the administration of in the event of any injustice or harm suffered by mistake of the court, it should be remedied by making the necessary correction forthwith. according to the principle of restitution, if the court is satisfied that it has committed a mistake, then such person should be restored to the position which he would have acquired if the mistake did not happen. this expression is established on the astuteness and clear sightedness that a wrong order should not be perpetuated by preserving it full of life or stand in the way under the guiding principle of so in all fairness, it is an inescapable and inevitable duty that if any such patent error on the face of it committed as in this case, the same must be undone wit hout shifting blame to the parties and without further ado being solemn duty of the court to rectify the mistake. ref: homoeo dr. asma noreen syed v. government of the punjab through its secretary health, department and others scmr plc c.s) reference to the above effect can also be made to sarfraz saleem federation of pakistan and others (pld supreme court ). after having an overview of the above referred principles, i feel no cavil to observe that this court has ample jurisdiction to remit the matter to the board of revenue, punjab to be treated as review in terms of section of the act, and decide as such. this writ petition is thus accordingly disposed of.
