(ii) whether the court must examine the surrounding circumstances to determine if her act was ruly free, voluntary, and uninfluenced, in the same manner as the courts assess the voluntariness of statements made by women before the executive authorities. it is well settled hat judicial proceedings carry sanctity, and ordinarily a statement reco rded before the ourt—particularly one bearing a thumb impression of the maker —should be treated as conclusive and not be allowed to be withdrawn. such statements are generally given ull weight because same are presumed to reflect the free and voluntary ill of the party making them before the courts. however, this principle is not an unbending rule of thumb. the court must examine the attending circumstances to determine whether the act was truly voluntary and free from undue influence or fraud. therefore, the reliance on case law cited by learned counsel for the petitioner is of no help on account of distinguishable facts. page w.p no. in the present case, a detailed analysis of the record rev eals multiple factors that the court must consider. the espondent was actively pursuing her claims for dower, dowry articles and maintenance, as also maintenance of the minors, both dependent upon the petitioner in the legal and social context of our society. it is well recognized that in such circumstances, the respondent ma be subject ed to considerable persuasion or pressure —social, emotional, or even subtle coercion —to reconcile with the petitioner for the sake of family cohesion or the welfare of the minors. notably, on .., the respondent appeared before the court accompanied only by the petitioner —husband, when in fact the case was not fixed for hearing on that date. respondent did not appear through her counsel, who had instituted the sui on er behalf and represented her independent choice. instead, she was represented by syed muhammad aurangzeb, advocate, a junior associate of the petitioner counsel from the same chamber. there was no independent adult male member of her family presen t. in the normal course of business involving any transaction and or sta tement in the court proceedings, husband of a female fully qualifies to be one imparting independent advice to a female, however, the same cannot be so construed in cases where husband and wife are standing in adversarial positions by asserting their respe ctive rights. in the instant case, this position is superimposed by the factum of subsequent dissolution of marriage between the parties. it is noted that .., the respondent recorded a statement withdrawing her primary claim, including the dower documented in the registered nikahnama, as well as claims for maintenance of the minor s. on the same day i.e., .., the respondent approach ed counsel of her choice namely, rao uhamm ad amir sarwar, advocate to challenge this withdrawal, asserting th at she had been induced by the petitioner to record the statement and that her consent was neither free nor voluntary. the immediate action on part of the respondent raises serious dou bts about the voluntariness of the disputed statement and page w.p no. casts skeptici sm over the petitioner assertion that the settlement or compromise was made voluntarily. had the withdrawal been genuinely voluntary, the petitioner could have brought the respondent and the minor to his home and lived with them after the settlement. instead, the circumstances suggest that the respondent was effectively trapped into relinquishing her substantial claim s, including her dower, which is based on registered document. the record further shows that the respondent appeared before the trial court through a counsel namely, syed muhammad aurangzaib, advocate, who is admittedly the associate of the petitioner counsel, who has confirmed this fact before this court as well. oreover, she was invited to record the withdrawal on a date which was no the original date of hearing, and was thereby deprived of the independent legal guidance she had chosen. these circumstances, viewed collectively, raise a legitimate concern that the withdrawal have not been fully voluntary and free from undue influence. it is in such situations, particularly in family matters, that the courts must apply careful scrutiny, similar to the manner in which it is expected that a woman should be supported independent advice before the executive authorities. the presence of ocial pressures, dependence, and possible inducement by the petitioner are factors that court cannot ignore merely because sanctity is attache to the judicial proceedings. accordingly, while the principle of sanctity of court record is important, it can not operate as an absolute bar against recalling a statement when the surrounding circumstances indicate that the act (of conceding statement) may not have been truly voluntary. in the instant case, the trial court is justified in considering these factors, and the withdrawal cannot be treated as automatically binding without such examination. this approach ensures both the protection of the sanctity, attached to the judicial proceeding and the safeguarding of the substantive rights of a vulnerable litigan t. page w.p no. at this juncture, it is imperative to address argument of earned counsel for the petitioner, who contended that the trial court lacked the power to review its earlier order. wh ile it is generally correct that a court does not possess power to revis it review its prior orders, except for error apparent on record, the circumstances of the present case are distinguishable. the trial court was acting pursuant to the order of remand rom the appellate court below, which required it to examine the special circumstances surrounding the stance of the respondent, which order was not challenged by the petitioner. moreover, under the family courts act, the act ), the courts are vested with procedural and equitable powers to ensure that and they are not strictly bound by the technicalities of the code of civil procedure, when dealing with matters within their jurisdiction. accordingly, the trial court reconside ration of the withdrawal was undertaken in exercise of its statutory fun ctions and therefore, cannot be held improper illegal. the petitioner counsel further argued that the courts below erroneously drew a distinction between the respondent origin al counsel and the subsequently engaged counsel as any advocate once engaged can accompany the client and record his her stance. ordinarily, no rigid distinction exists between an original and a later engaged counsel, and such technicalities are not determ inative of the validity of a statement. however, as observed above, the present case is exceptional. the subsequently engaged counsel, syed muhammad aurangzeb, advocate is admittedly a associate of the petitioner own counsel namely, advocate and belonged to the same chamber, raising a clear conflict of interest. he represented the respondent at the time she recorded her withdrawal, without the presence of her original counsel or any other independent support. the statement was recor ded in english language while the respondent is merely a matric pass lad y, who is admittedly a house wife and is not conversant with chicaneries of legal language. in these circumstances, the distinction drawn by the courts below was valid page w.p no. and justified, a it directly relate to the voluntariness and independence of the state ment recorded by the respondent. at this juncture, it is felt important to hold that in a dispute whenever a statement is to be recorded by a vulnerable litigant, like females in a family matter, the court must take all necessary steps to ensure that the statement is fully understood by the maker; the statement should be recorded in a language which the party comprehends; particularly, if the maker is illiterate, the presiding officer must ensure that she is accompanied by her kin, who is literate, having no adverse interest, and understands the statement she makes and it should be read over to her by the presiding officer of the court, who should specifically question such vulnera ble party to ascertain that she understands the contents and implication of the statement, and that it is being made voluntarily, without any inducement, undue influence, or coercion, and that she has the independent advice from counsel of her choice. suc procedural safeguards are essential to uphold the principles of natura in present case, hese procedural saf eguards were overlooked by the trial court when statement of the respondent was recorded on .. and when her application for recalling of said statement was initially dismissed on .., herefore, the said statement was rightly recalled by the trial court through the impugned order. in view of the above discussion, this court is of the opinion that this petition has no merits and hence, dismissed.
