() the registered person, his agent or any other person specified in sub -section () shall be bound to answer any question or furnish such information or explanation as may be asked by the authorised officer. () the department of' direct and indirect taxes or any other government departme nt, local bodies, autonomous bodies, corporations or such other institutions shall supply requisite information and render necessary assistance to the authorised officer in the course of inquiry or investigation under this section. () for the purpose of sub-section (), the board may make rules relating to electronic real -time access for audit or a survey of persons liable to tax. ..... searches under warrant.– () where any officer of inland revenue has reason to believe that any documents or things which in his opinion, may be useful for, or relevant to, any proceedings under this act are kept in any place, he may after obtaining a warrant from the magistrat e, enter that place and cause a search to be made at any time. () the search made in his presence under sub -section () shall be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the code of criminal procedure, (v of ). the statutory ramework incorporates safeguards to ensure that inland revenue authorities exercise their powers within legal limits. courts have consistently held that while revenue authorities possess broad authority to protect the public exchequer, such powers must be exercised fairly, reasonably and for purposes sanctioned by law. in the present case, the record does not disclose arbitrariness, mala fides, colourable exercise of authority or any overreach that may warrant interference in constitutional jurisdiction. no coercive action has been taken against the petitioner, nor has he been deprived of property or subjected to any measure beyond a routine inspection. parawise comments have been filed on behalf of respondent no., and wherein it has been expla ined that, pursuant to information received from fbr headquarters regarding the petitioner declaration of an unusually large carry -forward of input tax in the return for january respondent no. prepared desk audit report. on the basis of this repor t, the commissioner inland revenue, zone bahawalpur (respondent no.) page writ petition no. of issued an authorization .. directing verification of the petitioner stock position. the relevant documents annexed with the parawise comments substantiate the respo ndents stance and clearly show that the visit to the petitioner premises was not abrupt or unwarranted but was undertaken pursuant to a structured audit process and a formal authorization issued under section of the act, the authorization order itself sets out the objective basis for the action, that the petitioner had declared an exceptionally high carry -forward adjustment of rs.,, against stock values declared at rs.,,, -, necessitating verification. thi constituted a reasonable and legally sufficient foundation for initiating inspection proceedings. verification of such discrepancies is a routine and essential function of the tax administration to ensure accuracy of declarations. the commissioner, there fore, acted within his statutory mandate in directing the designated officers to visit the petitioner premises and examine the relevant record; their conduct was not personal or arbitrary but strictly pursuant to a lawful authorization grounded in identi fiable facts. the foremost question that arises in the instant case is whether proceedings under section could have been undertaken without first invoking section of the act, the answer is in the affirmative. the scope, nature, and purpose of the two provisions are distinct. section empowers the authorized officer to access business premises, registered offices, stocks, accounts, and records of registered persons or those liable for registration. this power is exercisable even when no adj udicatory or penal proceedings are pending, and is intended to verify declarations, ascertain factual positions, examine stock levels, and review records maintained under federal, provincial, or local laws. in contrast, section contemplates search and eizure, but only where the officer has reason to believe that documents or things relevant to proceedings exist at a place, and then only after obtaining a magistrate warrant. the two provisions thus operate independently: section allows routine inspe ctions for verification and transparency, while section regulates coercive searches linked to pending or contemplated proceedings. the petitioner argument page writ petition no. of erroneously conflates the two provisions and overlooks this legislative design. it is also elevant to underscore that section expressly authorizes inland revenue officers to access any business premises, manufacturing facility, registered office or any other place where stocks, business records or documents relevant under the act, are ke pt. the authority extends not only to registered persons but also to persons liable for registration, and further, to any person whose business activities may be required to be examined for any inquiry or investigation in any tax fraud committed by him, hi agent or any other person. this wide yet purpose linked statutory mandate enables revenue authorities to identify tax evasion, detect fraudulent input adjustments, uncover unreported supplies, and generally ensure that the flow of tax to the exchequer is not impeded through concealment or manipulation. learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon ghulam hassan case (supra ), contending that section of the act, cannot be exercised independently without recourse to section the reliance is, however, misconceived. in ghulam hassan case, this court held that an inspection under section must be confined to records in plain sight or voluntarily produced, and officers cannot compel production of hidden documents or take custody of records through coercion; any material obtained by compulsion would be legally unusable. in the present case, the petitioner own avermen ts in the petition confirm that the record in question was not obtained by searching hidden locations but was presented by the petitioner manager himself voluntarily. in the absence of any evidence to suggest use of force or coercion by the tax officials, and the fact that the petitioner manager voluntarily produced the records, the inspection clearly falls within the scope of section as interpreted in ghulam hassan case (supra). thus, the observations in ghulam hassan case regarding unlawful se arch and seizure are factually and legally inapplicable here. it is further necessary to clarify that although sections and of the act, serve closely related purposes e.g., inspection, page writ petition no. of verification, and retrieval of material relevant to the administration of sales tax, the legislature has consciously delineated the scope and intensity of the powers exercisable under each provision. the coercive power of search and seizure available under section once a warrant has been obt ained, is not available when an officer enters premises under section a position also supported by ghulam hassan case (supra), relied upon by the petitioner. under section the officer may access the premises, inspect records, and obtain material voluntarily produced or found in plain sight, but cannot compel production of concealed documents or seize property by force. these distinctions do not detract from the functional utility of either provision; rather, they affirm a calibrated statutory desi gn in which both provisions operate in parallel, each addressing different facets of the verification framework. redundancy cannot be attached to either provision. accepting the petitioner argument that a magistrate warrant under section is a mandat ory precondition for every visit would, in effect, deprive section of any operative field and render it redundant, an outcome that is impermissible under settled principles of statutory interpretation, which require that each provision be given meaningf ul effect. the legislature intent is clear: section facilitates routine, non coercive inspections, whereas section governs intrusive searches justified by the statutory threshold of reason to believe and relevant to any proceedings the statuto ry scheme therefore does not support the view that section is subordinated to section both provisions coexist to serve distinct yet complementary purposes within the broader tax administration regime. although the sales tax is an indirect tax ollected from end-consumers but deposited by the registered person, the taxpayer acts in the capacity of a collection agent of the state. this fiduciary role entails an obligation of full transparency and cooperation with lawful verification proceedings. a person holding funds belonging to the public exchequer cannot, in equity or in law, justifiably object to routine inspection proceedings meant to verify the correctness of declarations made by him. rather, such proceedings serve the larger public interes by ensuring that page writ petition no. of the tax collected from the public reaches the treasury without leakage, suppression or misappropriation. in view of the above, the proceedings under section were neither irregular nor excessive. the commissioner had a proper factual and statutory basis for issuing the authorization; the officers acted strictly within the scope of section no measure of coercion, seizure, or forced retrieval was adopted; and at no stage were the intrusive mechanisms prescribed under ection invoked. the petitioner, therefore, fails to demonstrate any infringement of legal rights. for the foregoing reasons, petition in hand is dismissed being devoid of any merit.
