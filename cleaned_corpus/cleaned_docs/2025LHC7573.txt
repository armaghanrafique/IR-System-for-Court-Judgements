crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of thereafter, the statements under section cr.p.c. of the accused were recorded wherein they refuted the allegations leveled against them and professed their innocence. the neither opted to appear as their own witnesses on oath as provided under section () of the code of criminal procedure, in disproof of the allegation leveled against them, nor produced any defence evidence. the learned trial court vide -- found the appellant guilty, convicted and sentenced them as mentioned above, hence, these criminal appeal for conviction s, crl. appeal no. of seeks reversal of acquittal of respondent under section -a and connected capital sentence reference before us. arguments heard and record perused. perusal of the record, evidence, and statements produced before this court indicates that the complaint (ex.pa) filed by umer nawaz (pw -) alleged that the appellant had posted and transmitted blasphemous material regarding the holy prophet muhammad (pbuh) and ummul mumineen hazrat ayesha (r.a) through whatsapp numbers. the complainant provided screenshots (ex.pa -) and a cd (ex.pa purportedly containing blasphemous content, asserting that the accused shared nude objectionable images with superimposed verses of the holy quran, the name of allah almighty, kalma tayyaba, and durood -e-pak. following approval from the competent authorit y, the fir was registered under section of the prevention of electronic crimes act, read with sections a, -b, -c, and of the pakistan penal code (ex.pp). upon scrutiny, it emerges that the mobile numbers cited in the fir were registered in the names of third parties and not the accused. learned law officer conceded that these third -party owners were neither made accused nor cited as witnesses. recovery operations under the supervision of deputy director fia (pw -) revealed mul tiple devices from appellants, page capital sentence reference no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of including laptops, mobile phones, sims, sd cards, and routers, such material cannot form the basis of evidence against the appellant s. furthermore, the complainant mobile device, on which the blasphemous material was allegedly observed, was neither forensically examined nor presented before the trial court. the testimony of the inquiry officer confirms that the device was temporarily in custody but returned to the complainant without proper forensic analysis. the compl ainant had also supplied the alleged content in hardcopy form. in the absence of independent verification, this electronic evidence lacks probative value. the complainant prolonged silence for nearly three years, despite being a member of the relevan whatsapp groups, coupled with his failure to produce the mobile device for forensic examination, constitutes a grave procedural lapse, directly attracting the mandate of article -a of the qanun -e-shahadat order, the statutory framework governing electronic evidence further reinforces this deficiency. article -a requires proof that the relevant automated information system was functioning properly at the material time. under article and its explanation, screenshots or printouts can attain the status of primary evidence only when generated, transmitted, and preserved through verified security procedures. article -a imposes the additional burden that where authorship or reliability of an electronic document is denied as in the present case the party relying on such material must affirmatively prove that requisite security protocols were applied. the prosecution has failed to satisfy any of these indispensable evidentiary conditions. authoritative law, particularly in ali raza v. state scmr unequivocally requires production of the very information system through which electronic material was generated, received, or stored. in the instant matter, no such evidence was presented. the solitary assertion of the complainant regarding embership in certain social media groups, without page capital sentence reference no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of establishing date, time, place, and mode of transmission, is legally insufficient. the charge framed against the appellants, devoid of particulars relating to date, time, place, and manner of occurrence, is vague and incapable of enabling an effective defence. cumulatively, these deficiencies render the prosecution case legally insufficient, factually sketchy, and incapable of sustaining a criminal conviction. the court has considered procedural complian ce under sections and -a cr.p.c. no prior permission was obtained under section cr.p.c. for taking cognizance under section -a ppc and the defence objection in this regard is legally sustainable. however, investigation under section -c ppc, which must be conducted by an officer not below the rank of superintendent of police (section -a cr.p.c.), was carried out under supervision of deputy directors of fia cyber crime reporting centre, rawalpindi, instead of officers of the rank statutori ly mandated. an offence under section -c ppc attracts a mandatory statutory protocol regarding investigation. section -a cr.p.c., reproduced hereunder, prescribes the rank competent to investigate such an offence: -a. investigation of offence un der section -c, pakistan penal code. —notwithstanding anything contained in this code, no police officer below the rank of a superintendent of police shall investigate the offence against any person alleged to have been committed by him under section -c of the pakistan penal code, (act xlv of ). this provision, couched in negative and prohibitory language, leaves no room for discretion or derogation. its purpose is to ensure that allegations carrying capital consequences are investigated with the requisite seniority, independence, and responsibility envisaged by the legislature. compliance with section -a cr.p.c. is also a constitutional imperative. article () of the constitution mandates that every person shall be dealt with in a ccordance with law, which includes procedural safeguards page capital sentence reference no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of expressly provided by the code. article ()(a) further stipulates that no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation, or property of any person shall be taken except in accordance wit law. in the present matter, investigation was admittedly conducted by officials below the rank contemplated under section -a cr.p.c., including sub -inspectors and deputy directors of fia, thereby constituting a material illegality striking at the root of the investigative process. reliance is placed on zubair saeed sabri sain zubair shah v. the state through a.g., islamabad and another (pld supreme court wherein non -compliance with section a cr.p.c. was held to render the investigation legally defective. regarding admissibility and authenticity of electronic evidence, articles -a, and -a of the qanun -e-shahadat order, and the electronic transactions ordinance, provide that evidence derived from moder devices or automated information systems is admissible provided the integrity and security of such systems are demonstrated. the prosecution failed to prove the electronic documents through verified security procedures, nor was any forensic validation of the complainant or accused devices undertaken. reliance on printouts or screenshots alone does not satisfy the standard required for primary evidence. reference is made to the case laws titled as ishtiaq ahmed mirza and others v. federation of pakistan and others (pld sc and ali raza alias peter and others v. the state and others scmr ), which hold that the authenticity of electronically generated material must be established through the system that received, stored, or transm itted such material. on a thorough review, multiple material contradictions, omissions, and discrepancies are evident. the mobile numbers were not registered to the accused; the complainant remained a member of the relevant whatsapp groups for three ye ars without raising any complaint; the sims and devices alleged to have transmitted the content are not conclusively linked to the page capital sentence reference no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of appellants; and critical technical details such as imei numbers were not recorded in recovery memos. these inconsistencies cr itically undermine the prosecution case. the appellants, including faizan razzaq, provided statements under section cr.p.c., denying all allegations. faizan razzaq specifically stated that the complainant has moved a baseless and frivolous application. in said application, he did not mention any whatsapp group link or any other source of information regarding admins of said whatsapp groups. fia authorities illegally involved me in this baseless case just to protect the real culprits. i am totall innocent and have never joined any blasphemous whatsapp group. the other appellant similarly denied participation. these categorical denials, in the absence of corroborative and reliable evidence linking them to the offences, carry substantial weight. it is further observed that the appellant are entitled to constitutional protections, including equality before the law, due process and protection of life and liberty (articles () and ()(a) of the constitution of pakistan, ). the settled prin ciple in criminal jurisprudence is that the burden lies on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and suspicion or moral satisfaction cannot replace evidentiary certainty. guidance is sought from case law titled as muhammad mansha v. the state scmr ), wherein it was held that even a single circumstance creating reasonable doubt entitles the accused to benefit of doubt. similar principles were reiterated in tariq pervez v. the state scmr ), mst. asia bibi v. the state (pld sc ), and najaf ali shah v. the state scmr ). the present case, with multiple procedural lapses, contradictions in evidence and inadequate forensic verification, clearly falls within this principle. page capital sentence reference no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of crl.appeal no. of the complainant delayed re porting, coupled with failure to surrender his mobile device for independent forensic examination, renders the electronic evidence inherently unreliable. through the electronic transactions ordinance and subsequent amendments, articles -a, and -a collectively mandate that electronic material be verified for proper system functioning, security procedures, and authorship. in the instant matter, the prosecution has failed to satisfy any of these statutory requirements, rendering the electronic evidence legally inadmissible. except for these pieces of evidence referred to above, there is no evidence focused upon the appellants, as they is confronting capital charge, they cannot be convicted and sentenced upon moral satisfaction alone in the absence evidentiary certainty to sustain the charge in a manner so as to exclude every hypothesis of innocence in order to ensure safe administration of criminal justice. it would be grievously unsafe to maintain the convictions. consequently, by extending benef it of the doubt, crl. appeal nos. of are allowed; impugned .. is set aside; the appellant are acquitted from the charge; they shall be released forthwith if not required in any other case. death sentence awarded to appellant is not confirmed. capital sentence reference no. -t of is answered in the negative. as a necessary corollary of the findings above, crl. appeal no. of stands dismissed.
