their nomenclature of chairman and members of the chief court as the chief (b) that the judicial officers of the subordinate judiciary in nort hern areas were allowed judicial allowance since and in the same manner the chairman and members of the court while holding higher judicial position as appellant authority of the district and sessions judges in northern areas were entitled to the judi cial allowance from the date of their induction in service which was permissible to the judicial officers of their status in the judiciary of pakistan. the ka na division, government of pakistan on the representation of chairman and members of the chief ourt having considered the matter moved a summary to the prime minister of pakistan on the subject terms and condition for the chief the remuneration and other terms and condition of service of the chairman or members shall be such as the federal government may, from time to time, determine and such terms and conditions as have not been provided for in this order or determined u nder this paragraph shall be the same as of a civil servant in equivalent grade or scale page in consequence to the recommendation of concerned ministry in the federal government of pakistan the competent authority approved the proposal for grant of judicial allowance to the chairman and members of the chief court and notification in this behalf was accordingly issued. the grievance of the petitioner is that they were entitled to the judicial allowance from the date of their induction in service with the nom enclature of chairman and member of chief court and not from a subsequent date. later the chairman and members of the chief court were re-designated as chief the notification was accordingly issued on 28th april whereby the chief learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that the chairman and members of chief court established under northern areas governance ordinance read with chief court establishment order were practically discharging the same functions as of the judges of high court of aj and the high courts in provinces of pakistan and that their nomenclature of chairman and members of chief court was also subsequently changed as chief therefore like judicial officers in the subordinate judiciary in northern areas who were allowed judicia allowances w.e.f 22nd november the chairman and members of the chief page court notwithstanding their appointment as civil servant in bps -, in terms of article of chief court establishment order by holding the judicial post in a higher forum ould be entitled to the judicial allowance without any discrimination. in nutshell the learned counsel submitted that the chief .e.f the date of their appointment as chairm an and members of the chief court. having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned advocate general and also the examination of the matter in detail we have found sufficient force in the contention raised in support of this petition. the chief as civil servants but subsequently they were awarded the status equal to the chief the chief court from the date of its establishment for all intend and purposes was a superior court in northern areas and i principle in the light of judicial status of the court, the chairma and members would be entitled to the pay and allowances and other privileges admissible to a superior court and competent authority in the federal government of pakistan also realizing the disparity awarded them the status equal to the judges of high cou rt of aj k. the judicial allowance permissible to the judicial officers of judiciary in northern areas and other parts of the country was also allowed to them from the date of notification issued in this behalf whereas they claimed payment of judicial allo wance from the date of their appointment. the chairman and members of chief court while discharging judicial functions of a high judicial forum would stand at par to other judicial authorities for all intend and purpose and had a legitimate right to clai judicial allowance from the date of their induction and since the judicial allowance was admissible to all judicial officers at all level for discharging the judicial functions therefore the page executive authorities were not supposed to withheld such benefi to the chairman and members of chief court in their discretion. consequently we hold that they were entitled to the judicial allowance from the date of their joining the service which was wrongly withheld. the northern areas governance order was of the status of fundamental law and chief court was established thereunder read with chief court establishment order as the highest judicial forum in northern areas. the chairman and members of the chief court by virtue of an amendment made in in the northern areas governance order were awarded the status of chief therefore, notwithstanding the issue of formal notification from a subsequent ate they would be entitled to same salary and allowances from the date of change of their nomenclature through the above amendment in northern areas governance order and we hold accordingly. the law department of the government of gilgit baltistan wi ll accordingly initiate process for approval of judicial allowance from the date on which the chairman and members of the chief court joined the service and salary admissible to them as chief this petition with the above direction stands disposed of with no orders as to the costs. chief
