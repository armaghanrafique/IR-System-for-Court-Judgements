with the statements of all pws. after closing the prosecution evidence, the learned trial court recorded the statement of accused iftikhar hussain, irfan karim, irfan ali, salman karim, baba jan, aleem u llah khan, ahmed khan, gulam abbas, musa baig, amir ali, sher khan, rashid minhas, sarfraz and shukurullah alias mithoo as provided under section cr.p.c. all the aforementioned accused except

numberdar juma khan, shukurullah baig and khan muzaffar -ud-din shah. the statements of the said dws were recorded. rom perusal of the said statements, it reveals that the story narrated by the said dws is not correct in the light of the statement of the accused baba jan recorded before the learned trial court under section cr.p.c. it is pertinent to mention here th at accused baba jan admitted his presence at the place of incident at the relevant time of occurrence in his statement recorded under section cr.p.c before the learned trial court. the learned trial court after hearing the counsel of the respective parties, evaluating the material evidence on record and consequent thereto on proven guilty, has convicted all the above accused respondent under section ,,, -a ppc section haraba of the offence against property (hudood ordinance section -l and of the anti terrorism act and awarded various sentences to them in accordance with law. the operative part of the said judgment

ammunitions from the mall khana of police station aliabad. the convicts -accused are responsible for the damages given to the government exchequer. hence, the cost of all the damages be recovered from the convicts -accused, as an arrear of land revenue, as per assessment and be deposited into the government treas ury. unquote (). the learned chief court while hearing appeals filed some of the respondent against their conviction recorded by the learned anti -terrorism court vide .. in criminal appeal no. allowed the appeals and set aside the judgment of the learned trial court. the learned gilgit -baltistan chief court was pleased to observe that: from perusal of prosecution evidence, it is evident that the learned trial court did not rely on the whole statement of any of the pw s. so the views and findings of the learned trial page court are against the principle of acceptance of whole of the statement of any pw or discarding the whole. the learned trial court has on the one hand accepted part statement of pws against some of the co -accused of the appellant and has discarded the other parts of the statement of pws regarding some accused. this view of the learned trial court is without any explanation on his part to that effect. the pws, who have even charged the appellant, have stated about mere presence of the appellant in the mob. mere presence of the appellant at the place of occurrence is never sufficient to prove that he shared the common object of the unlawful assembly. further the prosecution evidence does not show any circu mstance or circumstances showing attraction of the offences of section of anti -terrorism act and offence of section of offences against property (enforcement of hudood) ordinance the learned trial court has very wrongly tried the appellant for the said offences although none of the pws have stated in proof of any circumstance or occasion that showed involvement of the appellant for the said offences. we are of the opinion that the circumstances of the case stated by the pws constituted the case in hand, hardly a case of offences of section ,, and ppc and that also without any concrete evidence against the appellant. the prosecution evidence hardly shows page presence of appellant on the place of occurrence but without showing any role of the appellant in commission of the alleged occurrence of even the above referred offences. the second piece of evidence is the circumstantial evidence. in the case in hand, once it is established that reading of ocular evidence against he appellant is not only insufficient in the above circumstances but is wrong also. in such circumstances, circumstantial evidence is not only of no worth but also is irrelevant against the appellant. the learned trail court has accepted the statement of he appellant recorded under section of anti -terrorism act, and have read the same against the appellant. in our opinion, accepting or reading the confessional statement of appellant recorded under section -h of anti -terrorism act, is really astonishing as the superior courts of our country have repeatedly held such statement as not admissible and irrelevant against the appellant. the prosecution has leveled allegation of looting the weapons and cartridges from koth (mall khana) of police tation. in this connection, we do not find any evidence showing that the police has stored any weapons in the said koth (mall khana). in our opinion, the prosecution is bound to prove that they had stored the weapons, allegedly looted by the appellant, in the koth (mall khana) of police station. without such proof, merely alleging page that the looted articles were stored in the koth (mall khana) is never any proof of any theft or looting etc. as to medical evidence, mere proof of any injuries to any person is not sufficient to hold that the same were caused by the appellant. pws are not stating about causing any injury by appellant to the person or persons examined by the medical officer. so the medical report is not against appellant. in the sequel of ab ove discussion, we hold that the impugned order is very bad in the eye of law and merits reversal. we allow this appeal and set aside im pugned conviction and sentence. the learned advocate general submits that basically it was an unlawful assembly led by all the respondents. according to the section 147and section ppc every member of the said unlawful assembly is equally responsible for their common object of that assembly. he specially referred and readout the said sections which for convenience are hereby reproduced as under: section unlawful assembly. --- an assembly of five or more persons is designated an unlawful assembly if the common object of the persons composing that assembly is: first. to overawe by criminal force, or show of criminal force, the central or any provincial government or legislator, or any public servant in the exercise of the lawful power of such public servant; or second. to resist the execution of any law, or of any legal process: or third. to commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence, or forth. by means of criminal force, or show of criminal force to any person to take or obtain possession of any property or to deprive any person of the enjoyment of a right of way, of the use water or page other incorporeal right of which he is in possession or enjoyment, or to enforce any right or supposed right; or fifth. by means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to compel any person to do what he is not legally bound to do or to omit to do what he is legally entitled to do. section being member of unlawful assembly. -----whoever, being aware of facts which render any assembly an unlawful assembly, intentionally joints that assembly, or continue in it is said to be a member of an unlawful assembly. section punishment.-----whoever is a member of an unlawful assembly, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six month, or with fine, or with both. section joining or continuing in unlawful assembly, knowing that it has been commanded to disperse. -----whoever joins or continues in unlawful assembly, knowing that such unlawful assembly has been commanded in the manner prescribed by law or disperse shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to tow years, or with fine or with bot h. section rioting. whenever force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly, or by any member thereof in prosecution of the common object of such assembly, every member of such assembly is guilty of the offence of rioting. section punis hment of rioting .. whoever is guilty of rioting shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. section every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object.___ if an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as the members of the assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that objec t, every person who, at the time of the committing of that offence, is a member of the same assembly, is guilty of that offence. he further submits that the presence of the respondent in all the state aforementioned appeals have been admitted by the respondent themselves in their confessional statements etc which corroborated by the injured prosecution witnesses and the superinten dent of police who recorded their statements under section -h of the anti -terrorism act page .admittedly the recoveries of the crime articles were affected on the pointation of the respondent which is admissible under article of the qanoon -e-shahadat order he further contends that the ocular and circumstantial evidence coupled with medical evidence connects the chain committing crime by the respondent in all appeals, causing by the rioters of the unlawful assembly. all the respondent in all app eals played similar role and jointly participated in setting on fire the government vehicles, police station alongwith pakistan flag, police uniform, records, other government properties etc and looted the arms and ammunition thereto. the police personals were attacked, injured, humiliated and disgraced publically. all the respondent have failed to point out any enmity of police with them. the learned advocate general contends that now it is well recognized principle of dispensation of criminal a laxity, if any, on the part of investigation officer (io), which is an irregularity cannot, demolish the prosecution case. he also contended that the learned trial court has rightly relied upon a case reported in p.cr.lj that: procedural defect or irregularities and even illegalities in the course of investigation shall not demolish the prosecution case. page furthermore admittedly it was a day light occurrence and the eye witnesses have specifically mentioned the part attributed to the accused in their statement. he also contended that the learned trial court while convicting the respondent has rightly relied upon the case reported in -scmr- that: the court approach, while appraising the evidence, should be dynamic and not static. it should keep in view all the facts and circumstances of the case and if it is satisfied that factually the person charged with the offence has committed the same, it should record the conviction though there might have been some technical lapses on the part of the investigation agency prosecution, provided the same have not prejudiced the accused in the fair trial. the learned advocate general submits that the learned trial court has rightly convicted the respondent namely iftikhar hussain, accused irfan ali accused baba jan, accused aleemullah khan, accused sher khan, accused rashid minhas, accused sarfraz, accused musa baig, accused shukurullah baig alias mithoo and proclaimed offenders meher ali, deedar ali and driver nasir whereas the learned trial court has wrongly acquitted accused respondent irfan karim, salman karim, ahmed khan, ghulam abbas and ameer ali who have played the similar role in ommission of the offence who are liable to be convicted and be awarded sentences and fine according to law. page in support of above contentions the learned advocate general relied upon the following case laws: i. surendra others the state of u ttarpardesh scmr sc of india). ii. afzal another the state scmr ). iii. rashid ahmed the state, (shariat appellate jurisdiction) scmr ), iv. muhammad altaf and others the state scmr ). v. shafqat ali and others liaqat ali others scmr ). vi. saee others the state scmr ). vii. nallamsety yanadalah others state of andhra pradesh (scmr ). viii. naveed hussain the state pcr. lj gilgit -baltistan chief court. ix. gulbaz the state y.l.r ). x. imran ashraf others the state scmr ). on the other hand to and submits that this is case of clear acquittal as the foundation of the fir no. has broken into pieces and the same has lost its existence. they further submits that according to the fir there were more than accused rioters amongst them only accused have been implicated out of which have been released by the police under section cr.p.c while accused have been acquitted by the learned trial court page whereas the convicted accused were entitled for the same treatment under the law on the principle of consistency. they contended that the foundation of the said fir has been damaged and the same ultimately lost its existence. they further submit that the prosecution has recorded statements of twenty eight () prosecution witnesses (pws) and none of them have charged the accused assigning them specific roles in creating violence, instigating, rioting and burning the government properties during that occurrence. moreover, the statements of the pws are contradictory with eac other and the whole story based on presumption and hearsay. they also submit that the occurrence took place after death of the two persons as they were protesting for nonpayment of grants to the internally displaced persons (idps) on account of compensa tion to the affectees of the attaabad lake calamity. they argued that no pw mentioned the death of the two deceased who have been killed by the police and resultantly the mob had become aggressive and provoked by the police itself and it was a natural act to react by the mob after death of the two private persons. they submit that the unlawful assembly of the people was there on account of the protest as their cheques were being bounced and the mere presence of the present respondent on the spot does not ontribute any offence. the case is full of doubts and the prosecution has miserably failed to bring home a case against the respondent page beyond reasonable doubts. they also contended that benefit of doubt, if any, always goes to the accused and not to the prosecution. the learned trial court did not consider this aspect of the case and has wrongly awarded punishments to respondents. consequent thereto, the .. the learned anti -terrorism court was not sustainable and the learne chief court .. in criminal appeals no. and has rightly set aside the same being not well founded. they also contended that the accused are idps of attaabad lake and the instant case is based on political victimization. they further contended that the occurrence of the instant case is not pre -planned and pw sp baba khan has identified accused baba jan and accused iftikhar hussain instead of gulam abbas and accused ahmed khan. they further contend ed that there are contradictions between the statements of sp baba khan and sp tufail as well as the statements of recovery witnesses. they further contended that the belated recoveries of crime articles are fake as the recovery magistrate mentioned time as am while other witnesses stated that it was clock and the other pws says that it was am, am or am respectively. they also contend that pw sp tufail also stated that he has recorded the confessional statements of accused iftikhar hussain etc while sp baba khan also claimed page that he has recorded the confessional statement of the said accused. they further contended that injured person pws have not been examined at the nearest hospital at karimabad rather they have got treate more than km away at asqurdass. they also contended that no accused except accused iftikhar hussain has been arrested at the place of occurrence near police station aliabad. they further contended that injuries shown on the police personnel are als fake as per statement of pw dr. shahidullah baig. they finally argued that the .. the learned chief court is well reasoned and well founded, hence, no interference is warranted into it and the same is required to be ma intained to meet the ends of while arguing so they relied upon the case laws i.e. (i).pld sc (ii). pcr. lj (iii) pld sc (iv) scmr (v) pld sc we have heard the learned counsels for he respective parties at length, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned judgments of both the court below. the case laws cited by both the learned counsels have also been perused. the case laws cited by the learned advocate gener al are applicable whereas the case laws relied upon by the learned counsels for the respondent are distinguishable. page we have been fortified with the case laws referred by the learned advocate general wherein the all the facts circumstances of the case should be kept in view if a member of an unlawful assembly is committed the offence. the conviction should be recorded without going into technical flaws made by the investigating agency. in case surendra others the state of uttarpardesh (supra) it is held that the legal position is well established that inference of common object has to be drawn from various factors such as the weapons with which the members were armed, their movements, the acts of violence committed by them and the result. we are satisfied that the prosecution from the entirety of the evidence, has been able to establish that all the members of the unlawful assembly acted in furtherance of the common object. in case titled afzal another the state (supra) it is held that all the respondent alongwith others have formed unlawful assembly and attacked complainant party, injured to the pws. the respondent by virtue of the vicarious liability would be equally responsible for th commission of the offence under section and ppc as the respondent failed to convince that either testimony of the page injured witnesses was unreliable or the participation of the petitioner in the occurrence was doubtful, in case titled rashid ahme the state (supra). it is held that the prosecution has brought on record truthful and convincing evidence of the complainant and injured eye -witness. it has been proved that forming unlawful assembly and with common object in the commission of off ence, in case titled muhammad altaf five others the state (supra). it is held that every member of unlawful assembly to be equally charged for committing the offence with a common object, in case titled shafqat ali others liaqat ali oth ers (supra) it is held that accused forming unlawful assembly duly armed with common object, the presence of the accused at the spot testified by eye -witness and participation in the commission of the offence equally fell within mischief under section ppc, in case titled saee others the state (supra), it is held that out of rioters, were mentioned as accused and rest could not be identified, then all the accused would share the same responsibility under section ppc, in case titled nallamsety yanadalah other the state of andhra pradesh (supra), it is held that for the application of section ipc, the prosecution has to prove the presence and participation of each one in an unlawful assembly, in case titled imran ashraf others the state (supra), it is held that the court approach, while page appraising the evidence, should be dynamic and not static. it should keep in view all the facts and circumstances of the case and if it is satisfied that factually the perso charged with the offence has committed the same, it should record the conviction though there might have been some technical lapses on the part of the investigation agency prosecution, provided the same have not prejudiced the accused in the fair trial. in case titled naveed hussain the state gilgit baltistan chief court, (supra) it is held that confessional statement of accused, after the amendment in section -h of anti-terrorism act, whereby a proviso had been added to the section, legisl ature had made it mandatory that statement under said section would be admissible in evidence, which has to be read with the provision of section of anti -terrorism act, in case titled gulbaz the state (supra), it is held that accused has vol untarily confessed his guilt before prosecution witness who had fulfilled all the legal formalities in that behalf and accused, without any force or coercion, has admitted his accusation and said admission was admissible in evidence under the provisions of section -h of anti terrorism act, accused had failed to show any animosity toward the prosecution witness. prosecution case was fully supported from the recoveries affected from the spot of occurrence, positive report of bomb squads, the effective ly firing at the police party with intention to kill them which also page created terror and panic in the locality, had fully brought home the charge to accused. prosecution case was fully proved against accused. counsel for accused had failed to prove any ille gality or irregularity in the impugned conviction of the trial court which was the result of sound appraisal of evidence brought on record and to which no exception could be taken by the high court. (p. ). in view of the above discussion, after eva luation of the entire evidence of the prosecution on record and going through the aforementioned case laws in our considered view the prosecution has proved its case against all the respondent in all the above appeals beyond any shadow of doubts by produc ing ocular evidence, circumstantial evidence, confessional statement of accused respondents, recoveries on the pointation of the respondents, medical evidence and coupled with the absconsions of the accused respondents. we hold that the learned trial court has rightly convicted the accused iftikhar hussain, accused irfan ali accused baba jan, accused aleemullah khan, accused sher khan, accused rashid minhas, accused sarfraz, accused musa baig, accused shukurullah baig al ias mithoo and proclaimed offenders meher ali, deedar ali and driver nasir under section ppc read with section (d) of the anti terrorism act, and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay fine of (rupees one hundred thousand only) each. the above named accused are also convicted under section ppc and sentenced them to undergo () years imprisonment and the accused page to pay fine of rs.

appellant has assailed the -- the learned chief court gilgit baltistan, in cr. appeals no. and whereby the said criminal appeal filed by the respondent accused have been accepted by acquitting them. the concise facts as narrated are as such that a criminal case vide its fir no. lodged by ip gulzar hussain on -- at police station hunza aliabad nominating the respondent baba jan, ahmad khan shishkat, sultan ishaq, imam dad, sahib page khan, mohammad shah, ali gohar, deedar hussain residents of sarat, rahim mohammad and iftikhar residents of shishkat, on the charge of leading a provoked mob consisting people as a result of an incident due to nonpayment of compensation to the affect ees of ata abad by ubl, attacked police station ali abad by beating guard abdul qayum present on the gate of police station and entered therein and beaten police officials present at the time of occurrence in the police station namely saleem fc, wazir am an hc, saifullah fc, ayub fc zafar iqbal fc and putting on fire the govt. vehicle no. glta present in the police station and put on fire all the police station record, all official documents and official material and cases material present in maal khana and broken the arm store koth by looting police arms and ammunition present therein consisting smg nos, semi rifles nos, ammunition rounds consisting g3 nos, mm nos, mp nos, bore pistol nos, and the magazines of arms along with the arms of dpl consisting smg nos, nos bore pistols and essential articles and magazines and arp material including smg nos, gas gun nos, gas shell packets, police station gas gun nos, shell nos, hand grenade boxes, and also burnt police uniforms, beds, belts and then burnt the vehicle of police station gulmit page and also burnt the sho house and then the mob went towards bazaar. the police after investigation submitted challan against the accused before the anti terrorist court gilgit. the prosecution tried to lead oral as well as documentary evidence in proof of the allegations to corroborate the prosecution version with the help of confessional statements of accused recorded before the superintendent of police under section -h atc act the police, in exercise of powers conferred under section cr pc released the following accused out of a total of who were directly nominated in fir by the complainant sho and as per statement of some eye wi tnesses as well as the investigation officer, having similar role with the accused, who have been committed to judicial lock up for facing trial: sultan ishaq shishkat imam dad sarat sahib khan sarat mohammad shah arat ali gohar sarat deedar hussain sarat rahim mohammad shiskat iftikhar shishkat the police submitted challan against the respondent baba jan, ahmad khan and the other accused respondent who were not named in fir. the learned gilgit framed the charge of page accused as per contents of fir no wherein the respondent accused did not plead guilty and claimed trial. consequently, the prosecution has produced as many as pw in proof of their case excluding those which have been named in fir as eye witnesses by the complainant. after recording of evidence made by the prosecution witnesses, the trial court recorded the statement of accused respondent under section wherein they vehemently denied the allegation stating that they are not involved in the instant case rather they have been involved by the po lice due to political pressure and just to harass and humiliate them in the eye of society as they are having good reputation and they have never committed any offence previously and they further stated that their involvement in the instant case by the olice is only the result of being them as eye witnesses of another incident which took place in an another place in ali abad wherein two affectees of ata abad were murdered and five injured by dsp babar khan and his gun man fc azam khan and the police want to restrain them of being eye witness of this incident. lastly the trial court has concluded the case in hand by giving their verdict vide .., five out of the seventeen accuse namely irfan karim, salman karim, ameer ali, ahmad khan ghulam abbass were acquitted by the trial court while other page accused namely iftikhar hussain, irfan ali, baba jan, aleemullah khan, sher khan, rashid minhas, sarfaraz khan, musa baig, shukurallah baig and proclaimed offenders meher ali, deedar ali an driver nasir were found guilty of the following offences and sentenced by the trial court as under: in the light of the above discussions, i hold that the prosecution has proved the guilt of accused iftikhar hussain, accused irfan ali, accused baba jan, accused allemulah khan, accused sher khan, accused rashid minhas,

causing damage, house trespass, assault on public servant, bodily hurt to the injured persons, rioting, haraba (daeti) and create a sense of fear and insecurity in the area in furtherance of their common object, hence i convict accused iftikhar hussain, accused irfan ali, accused baba jan, accused allemulah khan, accused sher khan, accused rashid minhas, accused sarfaraz, accused musa baig, accused shuk urallah baig alias mitto, and proclaimed offenders meher ali, deedar ali and driver nasir under section ppc read with section (d) of the anti terrorism act and sentence them to undergo

them to pay daman of rs. (one hundred thousands only) each and sentenced them to undergo years imprisonment as tazir the amount of daman shall be paid to the injured persons. i convict the accused iftikhar hussain, accused irfan ali, accused baba jan, accused allemulah khan, accused sher khan, accused rashid minhas, accused sarfaraz, accused musa baig, accused shukurallah baig alias mitto, and proclaimed offenders meher ali, deedar ali and driver nasir under section offence against property (enforcement of hudood) ordinance read with section ppc and section (d) of the anti errorist act and sentence them to undergo

imprisonment. proclaimed offenders absconder accused meher ali, deedar ali and driver nasir are hereby convicted under section -i of the anti terrorism act and sentenced them to undergp ten years imprisonment. before parting with the file, it is ertinent to mention here that the convicts -accused have given a heavy loss to govt. exchequer by putting on fire the police station aliabad. and two govt. vehicles and have taken the arms and ammunition from the mall khana of police station aliabad. the convicts accused are responsible for the damages given to govt. exchequer. hence, the cost of all the damages be recovered, as an arrear of land revenue, as per assessment and be deposited into the govt. treasury. the accused respondent filed an appeal before the learned chief court gilgit -baltistan against the said conviction. the learned chief court after hearing pro and contra in its judgments dismissed the appeal of the state filed against acquittal of accused irfan karim, salman karim, a meer ali, ahmad khan ghulam abbass and accepted appeals filed by baba jan, iftkhar hussain sarfaraz etc vide its -, holding that the judgment of the trial court is bad in the eyes of law and meritless. the page present petitioner appe llant being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order the gilgit -baltistan chief chief court filed the petition in hand for leave to appeal before this apex court. this court admitted the case by granting leave to appeal. arguments ad vanced by the learned counsels of accused and learned advocate general gilgit baltistan heard in detail and record perused. the learned advocate general defended the judgment of the trial court up to the extent of accused baba jan, iftikhar hussain tc, sarfaraz khan etc but opposed in respect of accused irfan karim etc who have been acquitted by the learned trial court in the same judgment whereas the learned counsels of the respondent. the learned trial court based its findings on the following categories of evidences claimed to be produced by the prosecution which needs to be thoroughly examined in the light of law: (i) ocular evidence (ii) circumstantial evidence (iii) confessional statement of accused (iv) recoveries (v) medical evidence the first pinching point in the instant case is that out of twelve directly named and given same role in the fir, the police has discharged and released accused under section cr. pc which infect has demolished the pe rsecution story narrated in fir at the investigation stage. moreover, out of accused named in challan submitted u cr.pc, accused namely page irfan karim, salman karim, ameer ali, ghulam abbas and ahmad khan, having the same alleged role and partici pation in the occurrence as per statements of prosecution eye witnesses as well as investigation officer, have been acquitted by the learned trial court by rejecting the prosecution evidence and very surprisingly the other accused persons on the basis of exactly the same set of prosecution evidence, who could not be convicted and sentenced at all on the basis of such a rejected evidence and in absence of any other independent corroborative evidence but the learned trial court did it by co nvicting and sentencing them which is not only a gross violation of law but also against the natural justice. the db of honorable in its judgment under reference pcr.lj in a similar nature case has held that: the motive part of prosecution story, therefore, does not lend support to the prosecution case. apart from the above, four co -accused were acquitted by the learned trial a full bench of supreme court of pakistan headed by honorable in the case titled soba khan the state has held that: it is by now well settled principle of law relating to re appraisal of evidence that once co accused, similarly charged and page attributed same and similar role in a particular crime, is acquitted on the basis of same set of evidence where the witnesses have maintained no regard for truth while deposing on oath to tell the truth and nothing else the ordinarily they shall not be relied upon with regard to the other co accused unless their testimony evidence is strongly corrobo rated by independent cogent and convincing evidence. the supreme court of pakistan under reference scmr muhammad akram the state has held that: s. -a(i) ppc. case of vicarious liability. accused must be shown to share criminal act and also that criminal act was committed in concert and in pursuance of a prearranged plan, but in the present case no pre -concert and prearranged plan appeared to have been proved. trial court, in circumstances had rightly given benefit of doubt to acquitted accused. court had to sift the grain from the chaff and only one circumstances creating doubt in the mind of prudent man was sufficient to acquit accused by way of an abundant caution. if the trial court had acquitted some of accused persons by giving them benefit of doubt, that would not impair the veracity of the witnesses against the other accused whose, involvement in the case was established. accused were rightly acquitted. acquit tal upheld. the supreme court of pakistan in a case under reference scmr akhtar ali others the state (larger bench) has held that: s. ppc. eye-witnesses found to have falsely implicated five out of eight accused --- effect ---conviction of remaining three accused could not be based on same evidence without independent corroboration. appeal allowed. page the supreme court of pakistan in a case under reference pld sc shera masih another the state (fb) has held that: s. ppc. maxim: falsus in uno falsus in omnibus applicability. where the witnesses are found false against one accused, their evidence being of doubtful character would not be acceptable qua the remaining accused without independent orroboration and thus if the evidence of a witness is discarded to the extent of one accused, the same should not be automatically excluded from consideration qua other accused as the same can still be used against the remaining accused if it is supported by any other evidence of independent character. principle of falsus in uno falsus in omnibus therefore, cannot be accepted as a mandatory rule and given preference over the principle of sifting the grain from the chaff as by doing so the true spirit criminal administration of a division bench of lahore high court under reference nlr cr. lj muhammad anwar the state held as under: s. ppc. partial acceptance of ocular evidence against convicted accused and its disbelief qua acquitted accused would not be legally tenable. acquittal. the conviction and sentences the learned trial court is actually and factually based on section of the ppc and that the accused have been declared to be convicted as they were members of an alleged unlawful assembly but the trial court did not bother to look at the evidence on record as well as law for making an arguable foundation at least. before going to discuss on above points, i would like to discuss on the two fundamental issues in this case overlooked by the learned chief court and particularly the trial court which concluded its findings and conv icted the accused based page on the sole point mere presence of some of the accused on the scene of occurrence in absence of any attribution in the alleged overt act and by treating them same as members of an unlawful assembly under the principle of vicarious liability as well as constructive liabil ity without taking into consideration of non availability of evidence and its legal application and adaptation of due procedure during trial. thus we have to discuss the below mentioned points first: i. failure of learned trial court to frame charge under section ppc specifically. ii.failure of learned trial court in respect of appreciation and application of essential ingredients fundamental requirements of section ppc. iii. failure of trial court to specific framing of charges to justify its conviction and sentences awarded against the accused persons under the substantive offences. for a fair discussion on conviction under section we have to look at its essential ingredients of this provision, framing of charge by the learned trial courts usually and the charge frame by the learned trial ourt in the instant case particularly. a) section ppc states as under: every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object: if an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every page person, who at the time of the committing of that offence, is a member of the same assembly, is guilty of that offence. in order to apply section ppc, the accused must be: i. a member of an unlawful assembly ii. the overt act must have been committed in prosecution of common object or iii. the member of assembly must have known that such offence was likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object of the assembly. necessary ingredient of common object are, prior meeting of minds of accused to form a pre -arranged plan and some evidence to prove that accused were in concert and in pursuance of pre arranged plan then it could be said that the accused committed the criminal act. every member of an unlawful assembly must know that the offence likely to be committed is in further more of common object while convicting a person under this section necessary ingre dient for a constitution of the offence are prior meeting of minds of the accused to form a pre -arranged plan and evidence to prove that accused were in pre-concert and in pursuance of pre arranged plan, the offence committed. but it is an admitt ed fact that the prosecution totally failed to prove this main aspect of case as none of the prosecution witness uttered a single word to substantiate the contention of the prosecution as well as page conclusion of the learned trial court in respect of involv ement of accused under this specific allegation and applicability of section in this case. the whole case file does not possess any kind of evidence or even allegation that the accused persons pre planned to make an unlawful assembly with a common ob ject to commit the specific criminal acts charge sheeted. he record of the case does not disclose any kind of evidence that the incident was took place as a result of a pre planned act rather the record reveals that same was happened suddenly as a result of the tragic incident occurred in front of aliabad ubl bank a little bit time before wherein two civilian affectees of ata abad were killed and five injured as a result of firing of dsp babar his gunman fc azam. this fact is further substantiated and authenticated by the wordings of fir itself which explains that the incident took place as a result of provocation of the mob after the happening of the incident due to nonpayment of compensation by ubl. the accused were neither charge sheeted under in a specific way nor any evidence was produced before the trial court accordingly to prove and substantiate the ingredients of section and most interestingly none of the prosecution witnes ses attributed a single word about the alleged common object and also not attributed any overt act against any of the page accused in respect of the criminal acts charge sheeted. more interestingly those accused respondent were also convicted against whom there was absolutely nothing on the record. the surprising imposition of conviction and sentence of the accused respondent by the learned trial court under the umbrella and domain of section on the basis of just hypothesis, without farming of charge specifically, in absence of any cogent reasons and evidence on record in respect of section and and without affording any opportunity to the accused to defend themselves, is a gross violation of law. the prosecuti on also utterly failed to produce any kind of evidence in respect of these specific provisions during trial. therefore, the errors or omissions which are misleading and prejudicial to the accused or has occasioned failure of .. it is true that the learned rial court failed to frame substantive charges under -a ppc, section haraba of the offence against property (hudood) ordinance sections -l of anti page terrorism act as well against the accused persons. the char ges framed were for individual liability for these offences with the add of section pakistan penal code. the charges when framed wi th the help of section pakistan penal code, amount to telling the accused that they are constructively being held liable for offence committed by an other, who was a member of the unlawful assembly, in which they were also the members. it also amounts to telling them that they are not being accused of committing the offences with their own hands or of any participation in the commission of the said off ences. in such a situation, if the' charge under section pakistan penal code fails either by reason of the fact that unlawful assembly of five or mo re persons was not proved or some such reason, it is not open to the court to convict the accused persons of the substantive offence or offences. the omnibus statement about the culpability of the accused respondent in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses would in the circumstances of the case have to be considered only in the light of evidence of specific overt acts attributed to each and every accused which is missing not only in the entire prosecution case but also not available in the charge framed by the learned trial court as well unfortunately. therefore, in absence of evidence it is difficult to accept that the accused were memb ers of the unlawful assembly with the common object of committing the offence charge sheeted. in the page circumstances, it is held that section ppc is only an enabling provision and not a substantive offence and no sentence has been provided in this sectio so the conviction and sentence of the accused respondent awarded by trial court under this section is misconceived and it is highly unsafe to apply section and make everyone of them constructively liable. i, therefore have no hesitation in dismissing the prosecution case against the respondent on the charge under section thus the conviction sentencing of all the respondent accused und er section ppc by trial court has rightly been set aside by the learned chief court. having rejected the contention that the appellant were members of unlawful assembly, it would be equally unsafe apply section of ppc on the basis of omnibus statements made by the prosecution witnesses which is not corroborated. accordingly, the conviction of all the accused under section ppc also remains set aside. for a fair conclusion in respect of the implications of above provision and legality of trial procedure conducted by the trial court, it is extremel necessary to make a comparison between a charge framed by the courts in pakistan generally and the charge framed by the learned trial ourt in the instant case particularly as under: the framing of charge in a case u ppc used to be in practice as under: page charge: i------------- (name and office of the magistrate ------------------- (name of the accused) as flows: that you ------------------ on or about the day of ------ --------- at-------------- were member of an unlawful assembly, the common object of which was to ---------- specify the object ---------------------- and that while you were a member of the said unlawful assembly, another of member of the same committed ---------- (specify the act) ----------- and thereby committed an off ice punishable u -------------- of the ---------- which said offence was committed in prosecution of the common object of the said unlawful assembly (or which offence the members of the said unlawful assembly knew to be likely to be committed in furthera nce of the common object of the assembly), and that you thereby committed an offence punishable u of the pakistan penal code and within my cognizance. and i hereby direct that you be tried by the said court on the said charge whereas he learned trial court framed the charge in the instant case as under: charge: i raja sehbaz khan administrative gigit baltistan do hereby charge you accused iftikhar hussain muhammad ishaq, irfan karim karamat residents of aliabad, irfan ali arman shah murtaza abad, salman karim ibrahim, sher khan hamadullah baig aliabad hunza, baba jan abdullah baig nasir abad, allemullah khan taighoon shah hassan abad, ahmad khan ibadat, ghulam abbas muhammad residents of shishkat, amir ali s.o amir hayat, rashid minhas anees abdul mateen residents of ali abad hunza and sarfa rz ghulam musa altit hunza tehsil ali abad district hunza nagar that on .. at about hours along with your co accused proclaimed offenders meher ali farman ali, mithoo amanaullah residents of ali abad, driver nasir ghulam asul grilt hunza, driver musa baig abd-ur –reman and deedar amir ali residents of shishkat hunza enraged and attacked on the police station and entered in the police station after assaulting and battling the fc abdul qayum, fc saleem, hc wazir aman, fc saifullah, fc ayub, fc zafar iqbal and set on fire the government datsun no. glt a and entered in the police station and put on fire the record of police station and case files and the case properties. the koat was also broken by you and weapons --, nos rounds of ., rounds of mm, rounds of mp -, rounds of bore pistols, with spare magzines and necessary parts of different weapons nos, nos, bore pistols with spare magazines page and necessary things of abp, nos nos gas gun, bag gas sh ells, one no gas gun of police stati on, nos gas shells and boxes hand grenades were taken by you and the uniform of police personnel along with their beds boxes and necessary things were also set on fire by you. a vehicle of police station gulmit was parked in a work shop opposite the police station was also set on fire and also put the fire on the house of sho house by you. by doing this act you accused caused the lo ss of millions to the government property. thereby, you have committed an offence punishable under section ,, ,, -a, ppc, haraba and section of that anti terrorism act which is within the co gnizance of this court an i hereby direct you to be tried by me on the said charges it is clear from above charge sheet that the trial court totally failed to frame the charge as per ingredients of the section ppc specifically thus defeated the rights available to the respondent accused under criminal jurisprudence. the respondent accused are not being asked to defend themselves on the fundamental charge of criminal acts committed as a result of being a member of an unlawful assemb ly in prosecution of the common object of all the criminal acts mentioned above rather the accused have been charged to defend them as an individual liability against some criminal acts as happened in ordinary cases just aiding of section ppc. moreover, none of the prosecution witness examined who could support the contention of the prosecution to substantiate or prove the essential ingredients of this particular provision of section page thus the conviction based judgment under cover and domain of sec tion by imposing the constructive liability in a case of unproved charges has caused prejudice and injustice to the accused which is not warranted under the law thus not maintainable. the following citations will further substantiate the contention whatever stated above; pcr.l. arranged plan and some evidence to prove that accused were in -concert and in pursuance of pre arranged plan then it could be said that the accused committed the cri minal act (plj sh.c (aj k) every member of unlawful assembly must know that the offence likely to be committed is in furtherance of common object while convicting a person under this section necessary ingredient for constitution of the ffence are prior meetings of minds of the accused to form a pre -arranged plan and evidence to prove that accused were in pre concert and in pursuance of a pre -arranged plan, the offence committed. pld supreme court (ind.) if members of the fami ly of the appellant and other residents of the village assemble, all such persons could not be condemned ipso facto as being members of that unlawful assembly. it is necessary, therefore, for the prosecution to lead evidence pointing to the conclusion that all the appellant had done or been committing some overt act in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly. the omnibus kind of evidence that all the appellant and many more were the miscreants and were armed with deadly weapons like guns, spears, pharsas axes, lathis etc has to be very closely scrutinized in order to eliminate all air andh pra chances of false or mistaken implication. the case of each individual accused has to be examined to satisfy that mere spectators who had not joined the assembly and were unaware of its motive had not been branded as members of the unlawful assembly which committed the crime. p. a an accused is charged only with a substantive office cannot be convicted u read with substant ive offence. page air sc where an accused is charged only with an offence under this section read with the section dealing with a substantive offence, conviction in such cases for substantive offence would be bad if the accuse has suffered prejudice. a charge as a member of an unlawf ul assembly for an offence committed by a member thereof in furtherance of common object is a substantially different one from a charge against a person for an offence committed by him as a member of such assembly. a charge u puts the person on notice only of the fact that the wats committed by a member of the unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object or such as was known to be likely committed. section creates a distinct head of criminal liability commonly known as constructive lia bility which is not covered by section and (cr pc. (sc) ind air sc in sanichar sahni v. state of bihar therefore,... unless the convict is able to establish that defect in framing the charges has caused real prejudice to him an that he was not informed as to what was the real case against him and that he could not defend himself properly, no interference is required on mere technicalities. conviction order in fact is to be tested on the touchstone of prejudice theory. air sc in darbara singh v. state of punjab. in determining whether any error, omission or irregularity in framing the relevant charges, has led to a failure of justice, the court must have regard to whether an objection could have been raised at an earlier stage during the proceedings or not. while judging the question of prejudice or guilt, the court must bear in mind that every accused has a right to a fair trial, where he is aware of what he is being tried for and where the facts sought to be established against him, are explained to him fairly and clearly, and further, where he is given a full and fair chance to defend himself against the said charge(s). ocular evidence i) as per prosecution story itself, there is no dispute that the incident took place in a broad day light at a place on around kkh which is a thickly page populated and market place of ali abad town where hundreds of people used to be present all the time normally. but very surprise to note that the prosecution did not pro duce even a single independent person as witness hailing from the locality or even a non partisan, non -interested private person of any other place present there at the time of occurrence being a passerby. the fir itself speaks about presence of at least persons present at the place of occurrence which is kkh and market place and interestingly the pws stated before the trial court that the rioters and mob of unlawful assembly were and at the most in numbers who entered the police statio and committed criminal acts therein. this proves beyond any doubt that more than persons were present at the place of occurrence as spectators and not as rioters. but the prosecution miserably failed to produce none of them as eye witness being natur al witnesses. all the witnesses produced by the prosecution were interested and partisan being police officials their evidence is not trust worthy and free from doubts thus not reliable. ii) the learned trial court, while convicting the accused, has relied upon page those so called police officials as eyewitnesses of occurrence which are neither named in fir nor they could be treated as eye witnesses in the eye of law. the fir lodger pw16 is sho and complainant in this case who does not disclose the names of these so called eye witness at all neither in fir nor in his statement before the trial court wherein he once again emphasized correctness of the contents of fir. the complainant, being sho of same police station categorically named the below mentioned eye witness in the fir who were present in the police station when the provoked mob attacked. gate guard abdul qayum fc, saleem fc, wazir aman hc, saifullah fc, ayub fc zafar iqbal fc but it is very very surprising to note that the police did not record statement u cr.pc of above six officials at all and did not make them as eye witnesses of this occurrence and not named in witnesses column of chalan a well. moreover, the prosecution neither mentioned any reason for not producing them as eye witnesses nor claimed page wining over of them or any other reason or explanation for not examining them as eye witnesses in the court making the whole prosecution stor a concocted and false. the investigation officer remained mum in respect of fir named eye witnesses either in his challan report or in his statement before the trial court and also failed to explain anything in the challan report or even in his statement before the trial court in respect of missing of fir named eye witnesses. the investigation officer did not utter a single word of reason or explanation for not adducing them as eye witnesses before th court. as per timely lodged fir and statement of complainant recoded before the court makes it crystal clear that apart from the private people the above fir named officials were the natural and real eye witnesses of the occurrence who have been del iberately willfully pushed back from the occurrence scene and this act has not only created serious doubts about qua the guilt of accused but also demolished the prosecution case thus this sole point is enough to declare the prosecution case as false concocted. iii. as a result of attack on police station by mob, it is natural that several police officials should be injured. although no page medico legal certificate consisting about nature of injuries has been placed before the trial court in respect of any injured police official including these natural witnesses. however one pw dr. wali mohammad medical officer askurdas dispensary has been produced before the court and he endorses examination and treatment of injured gurad abdul qayum fc, saifullah, and zafar iqbal fc but the prosecution did not submit any medico legal certificate in this regard. pw dr. khuwaja khan of civil hospital ali abad as well examine fir named eye witness wazir aman hc and endorsed his treatment but no medico legal certificate is available on the record in this regard as well. all the above four fir named police officials were no doubt stationed and performing their duties in the po lice station when the mob attacked. thus their presence in police station as eye witness is beyond any doubt but non examination of these four injured and fir named natural eye witness has created serious doubts about the prosecution case and naturally and legally presumption has gone against the prosecution and they might not have corroborated the prosecution case as a result if produced and examined before the court. page in a similar nature case, the learned the finding in this regard is as under: non -examination of prosecution witnesses named in fir as eye witnesses whose evidence was material and admissible in order to arrive at just and correct conclusion, was not explained by the prosecution --- prosecution witnesses examined at the tria could not be termed as eye -witnesses of the occurrence and their testimony was neither unimpeachable nor reliable --- accused were not proved to have a strong motive to commit the murder of the deceased --- circumstance that the accused had already been sh own to the witnesses well in advance of the identification parade was fatal to the prosecution case which was inherently weak and full of material inconsistent and infirmities ---accused were acquitted in circumstance. --- s. --- appreciation of evi dence— below mentioned citations will make this point further clear: (db) pld lah. ghulam rasul. prosecution must call witnesses named in f.i.r. whether they support the prosecution or not. as a general rule, the prosecutor is bound to call all eye witnesses who are mentioned in the first information report unless he has reasons to believe that the witness if called would not speak the truth, or is unnecessary or is an accomplice himself. the mere statement of the public prosecution not support by any material upon the record that the witnesses were won over the accused, would not absolve the prosecution to produce material witnesses mentioned in the first information repo rt. if, however, the public prosecutor refuses to examine such witnesses, then a duty is cast upon the

statement of fir lodger complainant pw sho gulzar hussain, the mob entered into the police station by beating guard abdul qayum fc standing at the gate of the police station whereas all the above named so called eye witnesses contradicted the same by stating that the mob entered into police stat ion through windows of kitchen after breaking the same. interestingly the site plan expw a prepared and signed in presence of magistrate salman ali pw categorically states that the accused shukuralh baig along with mob had pelted page stones on the windo ws and roshandan of kitchen from garden of raja sakhi ahmad jan a place situated outside the police station towards east. this document does not show any indication that the window of kitchen was broken by mob and entered the police station through this wa y. this document further falsify the statement of pw mohammad ismail hc in respect of presence of shukur ullah baig in side the police station during the occurrence. moreover, the pw the fir lodger states to be inside the police station at the tim of occurrence but the pw mohammad ismail hc states that during the incident the pw was somewhere else outside the police station. the pw hc mohammad ismail falsify his own statement by saying that most of the rioters were muffled among them he ecognized some accused which is apparently seems to be untrue and self contradictory. v. that just to strengthen their statements, the following prosecution eye witnesses pretended themselves to be injured as a result of occurrence and stated to be examined and treated by the medical officers but no medico legal certificate in this regard has been produced by the prosecution before the trial court. moreover very surprisingly all the page three medical officers examined by the trial court, totally falsified the statements of the so called injured witnesses by not mentioning even their names in the statement before the trial court: pw- mohammad ismail claims that as a result of incident he became injured and he managed to reach asku rdas dis pensary and got treatment. but medical officer of this dispensary, dr. wali mohammad pw totally negates this story in his statement before the trial court and does not mention the name of this so called eye witness in his statement among tho se injured officials who were examined and treated by him on the day of occurrence. pw- mohammad akram baig claims that after the occurrence he went to doctor for treatment but none of the three medical officers examined before the trial court did mention his name in their statements. pw- sgc naeem ullah baig claims that on the day of occurrence he went to the house of iqbal karim from where at about p.m at night went to agha khan hospital at karim abad and got discharged after first page aid and thereafter they referred him to dhq hospital gilgit. interestingly no doctor from agha khan hospital came forward to substantiate his statement. however pw shahid ullah baig medical officer ali abad hospital contradicted his story by stating that the pw naeem ulah came to him on for medical checkup and examination and it was he who referred him to gilgit hospital. pw- hc ali ahmad jan stated in his statement that after the incident he went to doctor along with the injury sheet. but none of the three medical officers examined before the court mentioned even his name in their statements. vi. the learned trial court misconceived about the statements of accused respondent recorded u cr.pc before the trial court that they have admitted to be present at the place of occurrence hence liable to be convicted and sentenced. the statements of accused recorded under the above referred section careful perusal of record of case files page makes it clear that the acc used actually stated about their presence in respect of another incident reported under:- fir no. which took place at a different location of ali abad town at a different time on the same day wherein two affectees of ata abad were kille and five injured as a result of firing by dsp babar his gunman fc azam. the accused further stated that since they were eye witnesses of that incident as such the police has involved them in the present case to harass and pressur ize to stop them from giving evidence to save their police officials from the murder case. the recoveries. as per record of the case, nothing ecovered from accused baba jan, irfan ali, aleemullah khan, ahmad khan, ghulam abbass, ameer ali, rashid minhas mitt u, musa baig and shukurallah baig. however the prosecution has shown recoveries against accused iftikhar hussain, salman karim, irfan karim, sher khan sarfaraz khan but the same are highly doubtful, fake and unreliable because of the following reasons: i. as per prosecution story, the mob broke the koat and looted the arms and ammunition stored therein as per details mentioned in fir page but very surprisingly the prosecution could not produce any police record, document or witness to substantiate this fact that such kind and quantity of arms and ammunition were actually existed in the police station arms store koat before the incident and the same is missing as a result of alleged incident. ii. it is an admitted fact that the police could not show any recovery from the above named accused at all except the alleged recovery from the following five accused persons: salman karim: a gun on irfan karim: a semi automatic on iftikhar hussain: nos of mm live cartridges on sher khan: one bore shot gun on sarfaraz khan: nos live cartridges of 0n it is very interesting to note here that the learned trial court acquitted accused salman karim irfan karim having alleged recovery of fire arms of g- gun and a semi automatic rifle but convicted accused iftikhar hussain, sarfaraz khan sher khan having alleged recovery of commonly available live rounds and a bore shot gun. page iii. the prosecution, instead of making independent notables and respectable. of the locality, has made only police officials as marginal witnesses of all the rec overies despite availability of non partisan private public witnesses at spot being a place of thickly populated locality. the testimony of police officials thus has lost credence in such a situation and the recoveries would become totally unreliable when no public witness was associated with the recovery proceedings. moreover the recovered arms and live cartridges were not sent to forensic laboratory which resulted loss of evidentiary or corroborative value of the same as well. iv. alleged recovery of weapons and live cartridges from the above named accused have been made after a delay of and days of occurrence respectively. it is hard to believe that the accused would keep on hiding the police weapons in their owned places just for waiting for its recovery by the police in a situation when the police was searching their looted weapons like a hungry hunter and recovering the same from public places of ali abad own in a thrown away position. v. as per prosecution story and recovery memo ex pw a, two empty magazines of kalashnikov and alive rounds of mm were recovered from a plot having boundary wall owned by the accused iftikhar hussain at a place page known as gira located at a distance of meters from police station. but pw farman ali magistrate, specially brought as a witness to these recoveries, totally falsified the statements of prosecution recovery witnesses by stating that the number of alive rounds of mm rec overed from accused iftikhar hussain were and the same were recovered from a plo having no boundary wall at a different place know as gurman aliabad which is located at a distance of kilo meter from aliabad police station. vi. a recovery of ore sh ot gun has been shown against the accused sher khan by the prosecution. but it is very interesting to note here that the weapon of bore shot gun claimed to be recovered from the accused does not include in the detailed list of fir looted by mob from police station during the incident. in a situation explained above, the recoveries shown against the above named accused seems to be concocted, fake and not genuine and lacks credibility and reliability thus could not become a ground for a conviction against the accused at all. the following case laws further substantiate whatever discussed above. nlr criminal case title: muhammad akram the state. citation: sec objection of associating public witnesses with recovery is to obviate possibility of false implication of accused persons. recoveries would

act i. the matter pertains to the interpretation of legal position on confessional statement of an accused before the police officer in terms of section -h of anti terrorism court the statement of an accused relatin to inculpatory statement before the police officer is not admissible and on the touch stone of the same principle a confessional statement, in terms of section -h of anti terrorism act may have no evidentiary value and is not as such admissible. this apex court in its judgment under reference gblr has held that: the anti terrorism act is a federal statute and is made applicable to gillgit baltistan also thus the interpretation of section -h ibid to the contrary may not be -a of the constitution which assures fair trial. this is settled principle of law that any law or provision of law, in conflict to the constitution is not valid. page ii. the learned trial court while convicting and sentencing the accused respondent has based upon the confessiona statements of respondent accused made before the police officials under section -h of anti terrorism act terming the testimony of the same as admissible under the law and by doing so th learned trial court mainly relied upon a decision of learned chief court gilgit baltistan under reference pcr.lj but it is interesting to note here that this judgments has become overruled as a result of judgment of this apex court under refe rence gblr wherein it has been held as under: the basic principle of criminal administration of there is no cavil to the proposition of law that conviction can alone sustain on the basis of even a retracted confession made by an accused person before a judicial officer if it is found truthful and confidenc inspiring and since no sanctity is attached with the confession of guilt before a police officer therefore such confession cannot be considered at par to the judicial confession and is not admissible in evidence to be made basis of conviction. the ques tion of admissibility of confession of confession before a police officer under section -h of anti terrorism court was considered by the supreme court of pakistan in mahram ali,s case (pld sc supra wherein it has held that the confessiona statement before a police officer was not admissible and observation was made for suitable amendment of section -h of anti terrorism act this is settled law that a onfession made before a judicial officer subject to the credibility of page statement, was admissible in evidence, whereas a confession made before a police officer or any other person in authority or a private person, could have no legal sanctity and could hardly be treated as extra judicial confession in law. confession of the accused under custody before a police officer, could not be free from undue influence and coercion as police custody itself was considered coercion and a statement during custody could not be voluntary. this is settled principle of constitutional law that a person an accused of an offence, can not be compelled to be witness against himself and in that context the judicial confession made by accused voluntarily before the magistrate which was recorded after fulfillment of legal requirements, could be admissible as evidence against him but a conviction made before a police officer, could not be equated with the confession before magistrate because no presumption of its being voluntary, could be attached with such a statement.. there is no compulsion for the court to accept the confessional statement of accused recorded by judicial officer or a police officer, but confessional statement made before a judicial officer had evidentiary value to be accepted as eviden ce, whereas a confession made before a police officer as not considered legal evidence. the official auth ority of a police officer, may create an impression of compelling accused to make confessio in a similar nature case under reference mld it has been held that: recovery of hand grenades from possession of accused was not witnessed by any independent. police officials, were no doubt as good witnesses as any other from the public, but when in a case the very occurrence on the alleged date and spot was highly dou btful, recovery of incriminating material in the absence of independent witnesses, had to be looked askance at. alleged confessional statement of accused page thought had been recorded after fulfilling all legal formalities, but same having been recorded by a police officer, would cast a serious doubt on its voluntariness despite its admissibility under section of anti terrorism act question was not merely of admissibility or otherwise of a confessional statement, but the question was its voluntarin ess or otherwise before a person who could never be thought to be independent, impartial, non partisan and separated from those who were entrusted with the job of investigation. confessional statement of accused was of no help to prosecution as same was no voluntary. prosecution having failed to prove its case beyond any shadow of doubt, their conviction and sentence recorded by trial court were set aside and they were set aside free in the light of the above discussion, there can be no departure to the principle that a confession before a police officer is not admissible in evidence under the provision of qanun e- shahadat and cannot be used against the accused at the trial at par to the judicial confession for the purpose of conviction. the con fession before a police officer may carry the presumption of coercion and undue influence unless it is established on record that an accused voluntarily made a statement before a police officer quite free from any influence or coercion. the voluntary confe ssion before a police officer who is not associated with the investigation of case may have the status of an extra judicial confession which is a very weak type of evidence and cannot be relied page upon without independent corroborative evidence of sound and u impeachable character. thus i fully agree with the findings of honorable supreme court of pakistan given in mehram ali federation of pakistan sc and of this apex court verdict given in ateeq hussain etc the state case gblr ), wherein this issue has exhaustively been dealt with to declare the provision of section -h of anti terrorism act violative and ultra vires to the article of the gb (empowerment self governance) order read with article -a, and of the constitution of pakistan. the anti terrorism act is a federal law which has been made applicable to gilgit baltistan and a provision of federal law declared by the supreme court of pakistan ultra vires to the constitution of pakistan thus can no more treated as part of statute and would have no legal effect. the net shell of the above discussion is that: i. the prosecution demolished its case by not making those police officials as eye witnesses who were specifically named by complainant sho ali abad in his fir as witnesses being present at the police page station when the provoked mob attacked ali abad police station. ii. in presence of fir named eye witnesses, the manure and arrangement of other po lice officials as eye witnesses and recording their statements under section cr.p.c after an extra ordinary delay of to days without mentioning any explanation by the police and their contradictory and false statements before he trial court as explained supra, has made the prosecution case as totally unreliable highly doubtful false and fabricated, iii. the extra ordinary delay in making recoveries from out of accused and by making interested and partisan police officials as marginal witnesses to these recoveries and their contradictory statements as well made the recoveries as highly doubtful, false, concocted and unreliable, iv. no medico legal certificate existed on case file except police injury sheets mentioning no description nature of injuries of fir named witnesses along with examination of three medical officers as witnesses who stated to make ch eck up and treatment of those police officials on the day of occurrence who were named in fir as page witnesses but surprisingly the prosecution did not make none of them as eye witnesses of the occurrence demolishing its case as a result. v. the confession al statement of accused respondent before the police officer under section -h anti terrorism act has no legal effect being violative and ultra vires to article of gb (empowerment self governance) order and article -a, of the constitution of pakistan as declared by this apex court as well as supreme court of pakistan supra in the light of the above discussions, the appeals no. filed by the state stands fail and according ly dismissed. there shall be
