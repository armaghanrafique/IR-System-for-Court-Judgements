dead body of the accused was recovered from within the compound of the page respondent accu sed. similarly, recoveries of crime articles were made from the respondent accused, who were subsequently arrested. the facts regarding the rift between the accused and the deceased come on the surface. the respondent accused attacked the deceased during day light when he was returning to home after

the respon dents, weapon of offence alongwith empties have also been recovered from the accused and the said empties have been sent to the forensic laboratory. the report from the said laboratory is positive and supports the version of the prosecution i.e. that the deceased was hit by stone, dandas, fist then by axe and bore revolver. the empties matched by the said pistol affected from the

into their hands before the occurrence, during the occurrence and even after the incident while retaining the page dead body and chanting slogans in favour of their group, which is not tolerable in

offering prayer and was going on at the public path leading to his home. he had no intension to harm, attack or to kill any body, therefore plea of self defence is of no weitage and it is a lame

(pw admitted that said pw has not stated that any fir shot was page opened on the road (place of occurrence). that very strangely no crime empty of bore pistol was ever found at the road and the one crime empty was found in holaster of the accused, which only is sufficient to discard whole the prosecution case. that the recovery witnesses are police official and no independent witness has been associated and mandatory provisions of section cr.pc. have been violated. that the two eye -witnesses namely waz ir fida hussain (pw -) and pw (shakir hussain) were also witnesses on inc riminating articles of the day of occurrence but i.o. pw (sho) admitted that they did not disclose before him that they are eye-witnesses of the occurrence. that there is gross misreading of evidence on the part of trial court as well as appellate cour and the respondent no. has been unjustly denied acquittal and right of self defence has been denied to the respondent, which is divine gifted. that under islamic law of which aspect has not been taken note by both the courts below. finally, the learned counsel for respondent submits that the statements of mst. amina (pw -) has been recorded after delay of days of the occurrence and no explanation has been given regarding delay in recording page her belated statement. secondly, the said prosecution witness has been shown as eye witness of the occurrence but her na me is not me ntioned in the fir. thirdly, mst. amina through her statement did not give any specific role to any accused particularly the respondent no he further submits that no recovery has been made from the place of occurrence and even there is not an iota of corroborated evidence. the statements of all the pws are contradictory with one others and there is no consonance of the evidences with one another. the whole case is based on narration of a story based on hearsay, ence, the impugned judgment is liable to set aside as the same is a case of clean acquittal. he in support of his contentions relied upon the case titled atta muhammad the tate reported in scmr he also referred a reported case titled niaz muhammad alias niazi the stat e, pcr. lj page nlr criminal haji nadir khan etc the state, scmr muhammad khan and another the state, mld jan sher the state, scmr muhammad jamil muhammad akram and others, pcr.lj nasima bibi the state, scmr muhammad safdar bhathi the state, pcrlj ,muhammad sharif the state page and pcr.lj. lj ejaz ahmed alias gandhi and another the state. while going throug the .., the learned trial court in session case no. it is evident that the prosecution case mainly rests on the ocular account, medical evidence, recovery of weapon of offence, motive, statement of u cr.p.c and conspiracy hatched by the respondent with collusion of each other to commit the murder the deceased. according to the prosecution pw mst amina, pw wazir fida hussain, pw shakir hussain have given the ocular account of the occurrence. who saw th occurrence with their own eyes at the spot in day light and they are consistent with each other and they have fully described the role of the accused muhammad afzal, wali joo, sikandar and shafqat. (ii). the learned trail court has held that medical offi cer stated that two injuries found on the head of deceased one sharp edge weapon and secondly bullet injury. to the extent of these two injuries the respondent muhammad afzal in his statement under section cr.pc stated that on the day of occurrence, deceased emerged him in the street and taunted at him and gave him fist and kick blow after exchange of hot words, he took a small stone and pelted the same at the deceased which hit on his forehead and blood started oozing from the page head, after minutes the deceased returned while holding bore pistol and a dagger in his hands. the deceased kick the door of the compound and grappled with him and in process of grappling his own pistol went off and he fell down on the ground, he want to repeat the fire bu the cartridges stuck in the chamber of the pistol and under imminent danger and sure threat to his life, he took hatchet and gave a single blow on his head. the defence of respondent muhammad afzal not seems to be plausible as no injury as he stated to be found at the forehead on the deceased not supported by medical evidence, no injury mentioned on the forehead of the deceased and postmortem report exh. pw a, injury no. is entry wound, while injury no. is exist wound injury, no. is sharp edge gapping wound 3x21 cm in size, injury no. is also sharp edge wound remaining injuries are lacerated wound and abrission., so medical evidence does not support the version of the respondent muhammad afzal but to support the version of the prosecution. the respondent muhammad afzal have not stated or justified how other injuries i.e. lacerated wound and abrission came on the body of the deceased. if for a while and for the sake of arguments if his defence was accepted even then he acceded his right of self defence. the respondent muhammad afzal admitted the occurrence and the injuries on the head of the deceased. nothing could be page brought by the defence on the record to show that pws, the eye witness had any personal malice, or any animus against the accused respondent so as to falsely implicated in the case. the respondent no. muhammad afzal and wali joo caused injuries on the head of the deceased one by fire arm and the other by a sharp edge weapon on the vital part which does not show anything else other than their intention to take the life of the deceased. the blood stained earth was taken from the place of occurrence and thus it cannot be said that the occurrence did not take place at the place stated by the pws. in the opinion of the medical officer deceased died due to the above said injuries, thus the medical evidence supports the ocular version. (iii). as per prosecution evidence a respondent muhammad afzal armed with pistol at the time occurrence while wali joo armed with hatchet. pistol bore recovered on the pointation of accused muhammad afzal which was taken into possession vide memo exh.pw a in presence of the witnesses. according to the record. the recovered pistol from muhammad afzal was sent for fire armed expert opinion, the report of fire arm expert exh. pw is positive. the hatchet was also took into possession vide memo exhibited pw b. the hatchet also was sent for chemical examiner report lahore and found human blood, the chemical examination report is exhibited, hence this part of page evidence supports the prosecution evidence and it could not be discarded merely non association of private witnesses. the police officials are also reliable witnesses and they cannot be discarded merely for the reasons of their official position. the blood stained earth was also took into possession from the place of occurrence and sent for forensic report which is positive nature. the pistol which was shown to be recovered nearby the deceased was not sent for fire arm expert report hence it does not su pport the defence version as taken by accused muhammad afzal under section cr.pc. iv. as regard the motive of the case is that prior to the occurrence accused respondent injured muhammad ali deceased and his son muhammad iqbal and in this regard repo rt was got registered at police station skardu. the enmity between the parties was denied by the parties but during the arguments they admit there was political rivality. the learned trial court had observed that even otherwise it is not necessary that there must be motive for every offence. many offences committed without any motive or it may be shrouded mystery. there are chain of judgments of honorable supreme court of pakistan, where the superior court have not given due importance to motive when the of fence was otherwise proved against the accused. in our considered view the prosecution has successfully proved the motive behind the murder. as per page prosecution statement under section cr.pc. of pw mst. amina, shakir hussain, haji fida hussain and fid a hussain were recorded before the learned judicial magistrate. and these statement are inline with the statement recorded by the pws before the learned trial court and they have full implicated the accused muhammad afzal, wali joo, sikandar and shafqat and mentioned their specific role who caused injury on the deceased and due to the said injuries wazir muhammad ali succumbed. no doubt non of the pw stated before this court that their statement were earlier recorded u cr.pc by the learned magistrate. the learned trial court had held that before recording statement of pws under section cr.pc legal requirements were not fulfilled and therefore such statements could not be treated as substantive piece of evidence against the accused. v. according to prosecution the conspiracy was hatched up by muhammad hussain son naqi joo at his house. in this regard prosecution produced pw farman ali and pw fazil ali. according to pw ten ays prior to the occurrence hen went to bazaar for purchase of meat ut not found upon this he alongwith pw went to the house of accused muhammad hussain before entering the room he observed that some people were inside the room and the accused muhammad hussain was also there saying that they have no option but to page elimina te the deceased. whereas pw- fazil ali stated that on 4th may he alongwith farman ali pw went to purchase meat from bazaar but the same was not available therefore they went to the house of accused muhammad hussain when entered in the compound of uhammad hussain, he noticed that there were many shoes lying outside the room and he heard accused muhammad hussain saying to his companions that perforce they have to eliminate the deceased within a month. the learned trial court observed that the stateme nts of these pws are inconsistent with each other and not confident inspiring. prosecution has failed to prove conspiracy against accused muhammad hussain in these circumstances. the accused muhammad hussain was rightly acquitted from the charge. vi. in view of the above the learned trial court has held that the prosecution has also failed to prove the case beyond any shadow of doubts against the accused sikandar wali, shafqat hussain, mushtaq hussain, ejaz hussain, ghullam mehdi ashraf hussain, muh ammad kazim and munir. the medical evidence also does not support the prosecution evidence to the extent of the accused sikandar and shafqat as only two injuries found on the head of the deceased that is one is fire arm and other is sharp edge weapon, no lunt injury found at the head of the deceased consequently. accused mushtaq page husain, ijaz hussain, ghullam mehdi, ashraf hussain muhammad kazim and munir were acquitted by giving them the benefits of doubts. the learned trial court held that defence plea explained while replying under section cr.pc by the accused muhammad afzal that he himself in defence caused hatchet blow on the head of the deceased. the prosecution version and defence plea are to be put in juxta position and then it is to be seen a to which plea is more probable. in the present case keeping in view the evidence on record the prosecution version is more probable and the prosecution version is fully proved against accused muhammad afzal and wali joo beyond any reasonable doubt and rought guilt home against them by committing qatl -e-amad of the deceased wazir muhammad ali. the fatal injury and firing is attributed to the accused muhammad afzal, hence there is no mitigating circumstance against the respondent no. muhammad afzal, who alongwith his co -occused took the life of deceased wazir muhammad ali. consequently, thereto the learned trial court sentenced him to death under section ppc and shall also pay rs. one lac as compensation under section -a cr.pc to the legal heirs of the deceased wazir muhammad ali or in default payment of compensation he shall further under go six month rigorous imprisonment. page as regard to the respondent no. (wali joo) as he caused injury with hatchet on the deceased wazir muhammad ali was also convicted under section (b) ppc by the learned trial court and was sentenced to life imprisonment and to pay an amount of rs. one lac as compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased under section -a cr.pc failing to pay the same he shall underg further imprisonment for six month rigorous imprisonment. the benefits of section –b cr.pc was also extended to both the respondents. in appeal the learned chief court gilgit -baltistan have given full thought to the contentions of both the partie in the light of the statements recorded by the prosecution under section cr.pc. cr.pc. and contents of the fir, the recovery memos prepared the results of the forensic tests, the medical opinion of the postmortem and the circumstances of the case. the learned chief court, gilgit -baltistan observed that the incident between the parties has taken place as a result of minor differences which slowly have matured in intensity resulting in being bound down under cr.pc now the reason for the diff erences between the parties has not been brought on record. it may pertain to petty political difference or other exchanging of hot words which resulted into strong strained relation between the parties. on the fateful day the prosecution alleges that he convicts appellant due page to a pre planned mission had waylaid the deceased by first opening fire shoot at him and then giving hatchet bl ow and stone and danda blows the dragged the body into their own house which is at a distance of about yards fro the place of occurrence. the learned chief court also observed that the place of occurrence is the busiest area with the school, polo ground, shops and houses all around. the time mentioned of the occurrence is also of importance because it was about hours which is the time of the closure of the schools, other offices etc. it can be termed as peak hours of the village shigar at the busiest intersection from where road leads to difference directions. now if it is to be believed that the deceased received the fire shoot at the most vital part of the body i.e. the head and bullet had pierced the skull and had existed on the other side. the bullet injury of a nature which can result to instantaneous death. the second injury on the dead body of the dec eased as elaborated by the pws, ertain to the hatchet blow received by the deceased. the said injury is also of a nature which can result at instantaneous death of deceased. the witnesses examined have all stated that the hatchet blow also received by the eceased at the same spot. it can safely be presumed that the deceased had no chance to struggle in defence or to act in defence by taking out any pistol. neither has any witness recorded the fact that the page deceased had acted in any manner by producing a pis tol or any fire shoot in defence. the strange question arises that after doing away with the deceased what was the good reasons of dragging the deceased to a distance about feet from the place of occurrence to within their compound of the house. any prudent person would not in natural circumstances murder the person on the main road and dragged the dead body into their house to make matter worse. it can be argued and it had violated the sanctity of their house and hence was done away with. but this ver sion is again negated with a very vital piece of information supplied by the dsp the ac and one another pw who disclosed that as they entered the compound where the dead body of the deceased was lying they saw that on the left side of the dead body towards the west a hatchet was lying which was blood stains and a pistol was lying in the right hand of the deceased. the pistol was half loaded and the said pistol belong to th deceased which was of bore and license no. belonging to the deceased alongwi th six live cartridges. the learned chief court gilgit -baltistan observed that they highly impressed with the said piece of material evidence which has not been explained by the prosecution. now a twist appears in the prosecution story as to how was it po ssible tha the deceased who had been sho to death about yards away from the compound of the house of wali joo who at that page instant time had not made any attempt by taking out a pistol from his body and firing a sho after being dragged feet into he house of wali joo. how did the pistol belonging to the deceased? come alongwith the deceased to within the compound. naturally the pistol if at all had been used by the deceased at the initial site where the deceased had been shot it should have been le ft there. this material facts of a half loaded pistol belong to the deceased has not been questioned in any way which could have throw light on the manner of the occurrence. the learned chief court gilgit baltistan felt that the murder may not have happene in the manner as put forward by the prosecution. the only explanation regarding the holding of a half loaded pistol within the compound of wali joo means only thing and that is may be the whole matter of altercation between the parties resulting in the ire shot received by the deceased and hatchet blow has all taken place within the four walls of the compound of wali joo. wherein it can again be safely presumed that the first fire shot must have been opened by the deceased and second fire shot got stuck in the muzzle resulting in the half loaded pistol in hands of the deceased. it can again be safely presumed that the deceased received the fatal fire shot in his head by either the convicts appellant or his own pistol. the greater chance of the pistol injury of the deceased was by page the convicts appellant as when the occupants of the house saw a person taking fire shot at any of the family members he was shot death and also hit by the hatchet. it is again a question of presumption that after the initial fire shot by the deceased the hatchet blow may have resulted first and then the fatal fire shot on the deceased. the deceased intruded in the compound and grappled with respondent and in process of grappling his own pistol went off. and he fell down on th ground. the learned chief court gilgit -baltistan convinced that the deceased entered into the compound and fired a shot, the deceased down away by the present convict respondent by opening fire shot at him and then struck an axe blow to close the chapter. but if at all the bullet injury to the deceased was his own pistol and fire shot was of a very fatal nature than the complementary exe blow would amount to the acceding of his private defence. the right of private defence has been extended under law where reasonable apprehensions of danger arise from an attempt or threat to life. it is a right of protection not of aggression. as such we cannot give the privilege section ppc as pleaded by the convict in his statement recorded under section cr.pc. the part committed as alleged by the convict appellant wali joo is not proved from the record. page consequently, the learned chief court, gilgit baltistan considering the mitigating circums tance, the death sentence awarded to muhammad afzal by the lea rned additional session (wali joo) was set aside. we have heard the learned counsel for appearing on behalf of both the contesting parties, perused the record of the case file and gone through the impugned .. passed in criminal appeal no. by the learned chief court gilgit -baltistan as well as the .. the learned additional session we have also gone through the case laws cited relied upon by the learned counsel for the respective parties. in view of the above discussion we have no reasons to disbelieve such material evidence on record. in our considered view the learned trial court has rightly appreciated evidence according to the settled principles of law and the respondent no. (muhammad afzal) and respondent no (wali joo) deserve no concession at all and conviction cannot be converted or set aside on the basis of assum ptions and on technical grounds. the learned chief court, gilgit -baltistan passed the impugned .. as a result of misreading and none -appreciation of prosecution evidence page and material on record. the case laws cited by the learned counsel for the respondent are distinguishable. whereas the case laws cited by the learned advocate general gilgit baltistan and the learned senior counsel for the complainant are applicable and support their contentions and the prosecution case. for the above stated reasons, we have come to the conclusion that the prosecution has proved its case again st the respondent no. beyond reasonable doubts. in our considered view the learned trial court has rightly appreciated evidence on record in its tru prospective, dilated upon all aspects of the case and believed prosecution evidence by assigning sound reasons. consequently, the criminal appeal no. arisen from cr.pla no. filed by the state is allowed and the judgment in session case no. dated .. (vide fir no. under section ppc registered at police station shigar) the learned additional session (muhammad afzal) and respondent no. (wali joo). the respondent no. (muhammad afzal) is already in jail custody. however, he respondent no. (wali joo) shall surrender before the learned sessions whereas the impugned judgment in cr. appeal no. dated .., the learned chief court, gilgit -baltistan is set aside. consequent thereto he connected appeal no. arisen from cr.pla no. filed by muhammad afzal is hereby dismissed. before parting with this judgment we appreciate the able assistance extended to us by the learned counsel for the respective parties. announced today in open court. chief judge. judge. whether th case is fit to be reported or not?
